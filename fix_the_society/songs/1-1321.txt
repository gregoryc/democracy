Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
