Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Inert science they consecrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
