Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
