Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
