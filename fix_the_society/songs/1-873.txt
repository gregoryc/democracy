Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
