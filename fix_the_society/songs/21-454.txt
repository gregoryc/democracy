Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
