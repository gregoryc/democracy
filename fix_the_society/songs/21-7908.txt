Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
