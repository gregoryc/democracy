Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Playing only the worst card

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They act like a retard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
