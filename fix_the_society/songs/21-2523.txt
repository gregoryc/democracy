Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
