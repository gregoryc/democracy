Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
