Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
