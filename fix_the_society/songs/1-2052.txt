Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Evading conversation just like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
