Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
An open conversation, they always divert

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
