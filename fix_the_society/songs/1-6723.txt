VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Not talking isn't going to divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
