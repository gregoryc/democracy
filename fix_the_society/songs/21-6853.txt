Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate

Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
