Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They make broad statements while looking like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
