Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
