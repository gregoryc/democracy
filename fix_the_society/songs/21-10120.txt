Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
