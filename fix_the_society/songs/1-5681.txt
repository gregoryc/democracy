Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
