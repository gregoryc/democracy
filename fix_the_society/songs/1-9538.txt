Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
