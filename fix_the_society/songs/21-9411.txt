Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
