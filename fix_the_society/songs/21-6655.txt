Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
