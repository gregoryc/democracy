Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
