VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
