Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
