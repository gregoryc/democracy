Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
