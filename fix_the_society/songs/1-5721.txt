Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
