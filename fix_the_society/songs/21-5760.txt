Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
