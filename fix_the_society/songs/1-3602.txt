Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The state of science is, wholly inert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They hate themselves, they do not respect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is too insidious for many to detect

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The state of science is, wholly inert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They hate themselves, they do not respect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is too insidious for many to detect

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
