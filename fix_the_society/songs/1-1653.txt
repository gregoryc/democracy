Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
