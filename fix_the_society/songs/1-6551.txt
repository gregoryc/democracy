Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
I must speak here, I must interject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
I must speak here, I must interject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
