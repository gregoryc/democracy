Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is plain, anyone can detect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
