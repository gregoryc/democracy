Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The state of science is, wholly inert
Not talking isn't going to divert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

CHORUS

This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
