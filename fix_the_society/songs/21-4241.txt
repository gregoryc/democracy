Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
