Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
