Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
