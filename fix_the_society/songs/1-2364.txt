Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

An open conversation, they always divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
