Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
An open conversation, they always divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
