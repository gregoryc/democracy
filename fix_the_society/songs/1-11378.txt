Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
