Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
