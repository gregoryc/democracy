Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE
