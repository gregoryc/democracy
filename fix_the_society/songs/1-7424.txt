Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You make broad claims while acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

This is too insidious for many to detect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, they completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't think, you act like a kid

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't think, you act like a kid

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
