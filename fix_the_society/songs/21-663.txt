Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
