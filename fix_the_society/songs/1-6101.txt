Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They do junk, they do dirt

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Not talking isn't going to divert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
