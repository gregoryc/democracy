Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
