Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
