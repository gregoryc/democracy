Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
