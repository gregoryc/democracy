Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
