Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
