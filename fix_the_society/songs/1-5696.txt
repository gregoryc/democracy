Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

The society is the ones who hurt
An open conversation, they always divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
