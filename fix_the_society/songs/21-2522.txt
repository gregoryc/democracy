Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
