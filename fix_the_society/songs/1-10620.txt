Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
