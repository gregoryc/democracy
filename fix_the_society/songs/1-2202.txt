Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

CHORUS

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too insidious for many to detect

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
The society is the ones who hurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They do junk, they do dirt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too insidious for many to detect

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
