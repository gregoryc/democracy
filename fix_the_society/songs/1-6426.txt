Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
