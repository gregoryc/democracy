Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
