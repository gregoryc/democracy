Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
