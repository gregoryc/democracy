Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
No one will be unhurt

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
