Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
