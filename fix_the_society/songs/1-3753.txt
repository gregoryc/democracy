Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
