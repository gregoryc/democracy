Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

An open conversation, they always divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

An open conversation, they always divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They make broad claims while looking like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

An open conversation, they always divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

An open conversation, they always divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
