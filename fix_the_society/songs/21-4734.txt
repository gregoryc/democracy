Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
