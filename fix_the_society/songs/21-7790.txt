Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
