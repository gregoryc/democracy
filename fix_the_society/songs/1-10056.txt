Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
