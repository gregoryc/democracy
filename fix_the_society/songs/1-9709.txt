Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their behavior makes them charred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Reason is what they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
