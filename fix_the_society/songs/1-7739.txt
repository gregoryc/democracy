Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

CHORUS

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
