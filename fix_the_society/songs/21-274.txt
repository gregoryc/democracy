Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
