Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
No one will be unhurt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
