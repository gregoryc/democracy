Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
