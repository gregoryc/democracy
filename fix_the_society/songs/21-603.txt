Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
