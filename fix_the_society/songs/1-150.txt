Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
