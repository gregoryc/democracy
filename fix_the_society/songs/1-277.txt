Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The society itself, you completely neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

CHORUS

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
