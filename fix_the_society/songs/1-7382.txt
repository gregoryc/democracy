VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
