Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

Not talking isn't going to divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
