Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
