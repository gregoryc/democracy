Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
