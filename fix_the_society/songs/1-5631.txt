Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Science is  fundamentally inert

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
