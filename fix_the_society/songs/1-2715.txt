Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
