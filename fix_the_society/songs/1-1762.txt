Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
