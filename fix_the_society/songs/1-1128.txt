Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They make broad claims while acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
