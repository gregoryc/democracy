Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They do junk, they do dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They do junk, they do dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They do junk, they do dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

Reason is what they want to discard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
