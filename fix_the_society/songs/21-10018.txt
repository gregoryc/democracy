Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
