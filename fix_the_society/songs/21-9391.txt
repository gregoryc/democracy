Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
