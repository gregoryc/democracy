Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
