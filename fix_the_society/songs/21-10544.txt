Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
