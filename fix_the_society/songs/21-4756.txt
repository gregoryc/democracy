Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
