Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
