Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
