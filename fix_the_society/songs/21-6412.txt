Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
