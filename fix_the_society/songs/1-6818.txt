Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and complaining like a kid
