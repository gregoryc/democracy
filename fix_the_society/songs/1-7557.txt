VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
