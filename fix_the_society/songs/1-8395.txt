Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
