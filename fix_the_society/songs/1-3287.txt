Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
