Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
