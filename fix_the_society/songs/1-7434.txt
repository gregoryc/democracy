Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

You make broad statements while acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Evading conversation just like a kid

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
