Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
