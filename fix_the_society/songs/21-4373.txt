Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might

Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
