Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
