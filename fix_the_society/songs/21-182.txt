Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
