Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
