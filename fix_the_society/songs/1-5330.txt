Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
