Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
