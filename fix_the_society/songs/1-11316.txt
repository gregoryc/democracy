Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
You make broad claims while acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
You make broad claims while acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt
