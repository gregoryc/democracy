Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
