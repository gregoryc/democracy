Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
