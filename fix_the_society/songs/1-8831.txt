Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

If you talk to them they miss the subject
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
