Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
