Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
