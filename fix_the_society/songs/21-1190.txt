Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
