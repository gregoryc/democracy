Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
