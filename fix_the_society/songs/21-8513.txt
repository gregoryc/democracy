Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
