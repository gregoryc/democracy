Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
