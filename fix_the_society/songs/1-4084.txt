Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
