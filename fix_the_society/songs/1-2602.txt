Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They do junk, they do dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
