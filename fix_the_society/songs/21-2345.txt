Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
