Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
