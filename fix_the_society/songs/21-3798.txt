Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
