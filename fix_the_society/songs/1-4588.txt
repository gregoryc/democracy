Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

VERSE

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
You make broad statements while acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
