Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
