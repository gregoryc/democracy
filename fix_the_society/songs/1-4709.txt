Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
