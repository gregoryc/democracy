Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Inert science they consecrate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
