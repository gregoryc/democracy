Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
