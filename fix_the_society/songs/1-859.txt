Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

If you talk to them they miss the subject
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Not talking isn't going to divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They do junk, they do dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
