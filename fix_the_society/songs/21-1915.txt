Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
