Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The state of science is, wholly inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
