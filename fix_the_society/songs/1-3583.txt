Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
