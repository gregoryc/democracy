Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
