Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
