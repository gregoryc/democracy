Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
