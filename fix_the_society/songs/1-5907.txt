Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

CHORUS

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
