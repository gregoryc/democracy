Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
