Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
