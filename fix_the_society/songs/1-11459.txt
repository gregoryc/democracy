Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

CHORUS

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Not talking isn't going to divert
The state of science is, wholly inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Not talking isn't going to divert
The state of science is, wholly inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They hate themselves, they do not respect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
