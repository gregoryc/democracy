Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Inert science they consecrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
