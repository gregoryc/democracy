Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

You make broad claims while looking like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

You make broad claims while looking like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
