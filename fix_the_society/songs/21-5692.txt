Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
