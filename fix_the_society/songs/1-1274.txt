VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
