Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
