Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Whining and crying like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
