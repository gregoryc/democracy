Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Not talking isn't going to divert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

Not talking isn't going to divert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

CHORUS

Not talking isn't going to divert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
