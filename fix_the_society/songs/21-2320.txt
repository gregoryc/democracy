Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
