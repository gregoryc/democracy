Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They do junk, they do dirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Whining and moaning like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Whining and moaning like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Whining and moaning like a kid

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Whining and moaning like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
