Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
An open conversation, they always divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

This is too insidious for many to detect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
