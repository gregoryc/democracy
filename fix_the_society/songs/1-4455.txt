Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
An open conversation, they always divert

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their minds, they cannot exert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
