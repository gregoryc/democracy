Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

They do junk, they do dirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

VERSE

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
