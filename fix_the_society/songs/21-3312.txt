Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
