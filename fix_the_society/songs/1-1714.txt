Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
