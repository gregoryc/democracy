Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
