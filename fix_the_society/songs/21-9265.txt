Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
