Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
