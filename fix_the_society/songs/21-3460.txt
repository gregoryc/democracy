Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
