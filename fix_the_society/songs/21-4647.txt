Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
