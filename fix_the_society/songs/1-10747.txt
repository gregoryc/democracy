Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
