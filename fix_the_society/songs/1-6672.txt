Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

CHORUS

This is obvious, anyone can detect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
