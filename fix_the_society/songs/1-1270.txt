Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The state of science is, wholly inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

CHORUS

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They hate themselves, they do not respect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS
