VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their own principles are something they do not respect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

I must speak here, I must interject
This is too insidious for many to detect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
