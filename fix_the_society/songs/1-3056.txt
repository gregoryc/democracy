Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

CHORUS

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
