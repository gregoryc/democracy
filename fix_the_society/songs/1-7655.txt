Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Not talking isn't going to divert

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Not talking isn't going to divert

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
No one will be unhurt

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Not talking isn't going to divert

VERSE

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
