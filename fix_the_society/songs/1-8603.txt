Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
