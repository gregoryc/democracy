Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
