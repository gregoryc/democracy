Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
