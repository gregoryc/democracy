Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
