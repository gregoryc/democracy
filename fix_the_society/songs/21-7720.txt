Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
