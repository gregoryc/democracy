Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
