Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
