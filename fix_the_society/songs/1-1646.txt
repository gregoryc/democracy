VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

CHORUS

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

CHORUS

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
