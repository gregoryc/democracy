Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
