Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
I must speak here, I must interject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
