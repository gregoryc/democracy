Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
