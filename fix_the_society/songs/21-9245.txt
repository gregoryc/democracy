Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
