Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
