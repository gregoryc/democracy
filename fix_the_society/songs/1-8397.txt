Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
An open conversation, they always divert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
