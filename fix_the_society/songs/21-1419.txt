Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
