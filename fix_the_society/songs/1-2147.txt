Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
