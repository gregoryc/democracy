Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
