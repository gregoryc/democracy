Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
