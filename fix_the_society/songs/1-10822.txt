Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This is plain, anyone can detect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
