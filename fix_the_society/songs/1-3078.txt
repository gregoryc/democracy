Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Their minds, they cannot exert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
