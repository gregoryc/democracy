Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
