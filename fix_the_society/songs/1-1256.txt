Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

VERSE

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

CHORUS

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
