Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
