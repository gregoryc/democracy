Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
