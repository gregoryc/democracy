Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
