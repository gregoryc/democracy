Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
