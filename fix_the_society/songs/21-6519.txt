Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
