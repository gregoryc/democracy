Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

The society itself, they completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
