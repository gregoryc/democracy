Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
