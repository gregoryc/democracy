Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Away from the truth they hid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

VERSE

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
