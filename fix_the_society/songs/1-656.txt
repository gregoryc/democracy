Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Running away from conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
