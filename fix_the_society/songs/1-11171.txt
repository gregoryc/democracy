Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
