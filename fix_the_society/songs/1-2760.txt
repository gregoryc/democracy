VERSE

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

This is too insidious for many to detect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
