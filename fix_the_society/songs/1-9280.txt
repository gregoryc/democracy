Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

VERSE

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
