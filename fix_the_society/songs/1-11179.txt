Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their minds, they cannot exert
Not talking isn't going to divert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
