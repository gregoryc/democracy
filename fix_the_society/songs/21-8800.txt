Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
