Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
