Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard

The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
