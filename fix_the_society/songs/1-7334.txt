VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt

VERSE

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
