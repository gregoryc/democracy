Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
