Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, you completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
