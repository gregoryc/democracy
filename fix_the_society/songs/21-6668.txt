Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
