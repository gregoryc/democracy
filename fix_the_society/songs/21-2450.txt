Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
