Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
