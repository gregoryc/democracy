Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
