Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
