Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
You don't think, they act like a kid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
