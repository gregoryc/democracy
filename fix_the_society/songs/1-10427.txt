Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too insidious for many to detect

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
