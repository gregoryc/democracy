Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
