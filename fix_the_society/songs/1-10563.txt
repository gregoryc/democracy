Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
Reason is what they want to discard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
Reason is what they want to discard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

I must speak here, I must interject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
