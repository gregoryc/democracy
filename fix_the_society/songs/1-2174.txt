Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Evading conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
