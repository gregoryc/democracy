Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Complete neglect, complete inattention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
