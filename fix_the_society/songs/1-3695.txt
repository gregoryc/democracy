Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

If you talk to them they miss the subject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, they completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You make broad claims while looking like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, they completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

CHORUS

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
