Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
