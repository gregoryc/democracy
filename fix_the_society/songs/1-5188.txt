Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
