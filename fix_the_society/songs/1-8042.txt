VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
