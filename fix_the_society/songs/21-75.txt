Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
