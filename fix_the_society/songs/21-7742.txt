Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
