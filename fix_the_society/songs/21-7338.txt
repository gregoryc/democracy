Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
