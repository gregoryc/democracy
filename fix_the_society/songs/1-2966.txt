Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
