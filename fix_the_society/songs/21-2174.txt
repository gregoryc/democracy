Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
