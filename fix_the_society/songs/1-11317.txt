Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
