Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
