Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
