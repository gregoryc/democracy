VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
