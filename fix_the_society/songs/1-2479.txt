Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Playing only the worst card

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
An open conversation, they always divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
