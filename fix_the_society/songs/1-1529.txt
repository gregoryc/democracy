Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You make broad claims while looking like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
