Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
