Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
They do junk, they do dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
They do junk, they do dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
They do junk, they do dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
