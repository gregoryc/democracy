Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
