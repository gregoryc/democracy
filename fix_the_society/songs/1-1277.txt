Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
