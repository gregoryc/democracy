Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
