Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
