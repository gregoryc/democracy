Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
