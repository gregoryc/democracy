Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
The state of science is, wholly inert

VERSE

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
