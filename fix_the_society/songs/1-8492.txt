Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
