Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
