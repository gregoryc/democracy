VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
