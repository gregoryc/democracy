Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
