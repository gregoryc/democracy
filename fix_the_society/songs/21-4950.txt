Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
