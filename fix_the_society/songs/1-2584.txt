Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

I must speak here, I must interject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is plain, anyone can detect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
