Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

This is too insidious for many to detect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
