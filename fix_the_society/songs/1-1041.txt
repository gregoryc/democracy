VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
