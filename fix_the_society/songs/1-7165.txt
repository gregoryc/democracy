Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They hate themselves, they do not respect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
