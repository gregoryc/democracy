Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

CHORUS

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
No one will be unhurt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
