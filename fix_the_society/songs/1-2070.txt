Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
The state of science is, wholly inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
