Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
