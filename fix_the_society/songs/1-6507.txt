Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
