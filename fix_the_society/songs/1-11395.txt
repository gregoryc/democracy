Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
