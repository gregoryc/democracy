Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
