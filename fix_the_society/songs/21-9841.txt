Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
