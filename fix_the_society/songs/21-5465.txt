Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Inert science they consecrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
