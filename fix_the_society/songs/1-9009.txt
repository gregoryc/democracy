Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
I must speak here, I must interject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

CHORUS

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
