Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
