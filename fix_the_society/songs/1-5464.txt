Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, they completely neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

If you talk to them they miss the subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
