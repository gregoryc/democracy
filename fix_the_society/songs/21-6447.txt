Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Inert science they consecrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
