Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
