Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
