Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

CHORUS

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
