Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, they completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
