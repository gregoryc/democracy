VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
