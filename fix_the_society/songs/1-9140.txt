Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The society itself, they completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
