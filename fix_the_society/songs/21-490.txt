Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
