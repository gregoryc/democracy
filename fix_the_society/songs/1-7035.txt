Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Playing only the worst card
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
