Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Inert science they consecrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
