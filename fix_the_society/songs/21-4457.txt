Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
