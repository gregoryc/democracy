Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
