Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
