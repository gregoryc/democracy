Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They do junk, they do dirt
No one will be unhurt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
