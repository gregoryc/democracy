Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
