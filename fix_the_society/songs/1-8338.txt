Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

CHORUS

This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
