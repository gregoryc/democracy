Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
