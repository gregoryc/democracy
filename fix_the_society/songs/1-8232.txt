Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Their own principles are something they do not respect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The society itself, they completely neglect
