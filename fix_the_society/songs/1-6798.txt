Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You make broad claims while looking like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You make broad claims while looking like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
