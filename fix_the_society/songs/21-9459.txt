Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
