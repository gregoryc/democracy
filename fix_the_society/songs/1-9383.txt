Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They hate themselves, they do not respect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

CHORUS

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, they completely neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Not talking isn't going to divert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
