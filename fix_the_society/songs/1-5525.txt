Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
