Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Among their insular cliques they congregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
