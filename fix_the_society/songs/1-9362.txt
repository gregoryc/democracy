Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Don't have to do with ego or id
You make broad claims while looking like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
