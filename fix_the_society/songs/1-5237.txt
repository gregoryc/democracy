Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
