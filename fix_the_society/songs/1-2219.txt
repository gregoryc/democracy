Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and crying like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Reason is what they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
