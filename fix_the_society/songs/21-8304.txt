Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
