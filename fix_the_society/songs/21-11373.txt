Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
