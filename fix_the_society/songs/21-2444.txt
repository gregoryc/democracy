Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
