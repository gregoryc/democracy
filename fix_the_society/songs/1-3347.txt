Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Playing only the worst card
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

The full picture is something they habitually disregard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
