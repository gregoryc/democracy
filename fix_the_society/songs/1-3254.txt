VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

VERSE

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
