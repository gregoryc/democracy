Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
