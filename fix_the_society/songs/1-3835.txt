Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too insidious for many to detect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
