Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They do junk, they do dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
I must speak here, I must interject

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They do junk, they do dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Not talking isn't going to divert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
