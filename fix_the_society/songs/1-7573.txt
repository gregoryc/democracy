Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

This is too insidious for many to detect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
