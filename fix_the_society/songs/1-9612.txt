Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
