VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
