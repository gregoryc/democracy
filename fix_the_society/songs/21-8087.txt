Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
