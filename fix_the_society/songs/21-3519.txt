Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
