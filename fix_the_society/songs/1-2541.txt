VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They do junk, they do dirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They do junk, they do dirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They do junk, they do dirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They do junk, they do dirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
