Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
I must speak here, I must interject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and complaining like a kid
