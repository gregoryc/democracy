Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
