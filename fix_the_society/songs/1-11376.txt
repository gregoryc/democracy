Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They do junk, they do dirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Away from the truth they hid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
