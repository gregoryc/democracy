Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
