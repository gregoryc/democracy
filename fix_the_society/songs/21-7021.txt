Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
