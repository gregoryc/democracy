Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Evading conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
