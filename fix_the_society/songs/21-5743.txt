Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
