VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Science is  fundamentally inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, you completely neglect

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
