Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

The society itself, you completely neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
