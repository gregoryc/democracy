Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

If you talk to them they miss the subject
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Not talking isn't going to divert

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
