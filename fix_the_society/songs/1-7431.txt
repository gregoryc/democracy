VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Not talking isn't going to divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
