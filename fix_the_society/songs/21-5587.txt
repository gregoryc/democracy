Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
