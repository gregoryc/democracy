Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
