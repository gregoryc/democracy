Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
