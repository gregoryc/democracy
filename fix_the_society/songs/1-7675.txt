Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They do junk, they do dirt

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
