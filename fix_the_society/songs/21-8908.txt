Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
