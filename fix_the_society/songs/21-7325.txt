Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
