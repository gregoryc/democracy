Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
