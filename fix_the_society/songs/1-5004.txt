Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, they completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
