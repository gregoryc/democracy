Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and complaining like a kid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

CHORUS

This is obvious, anyone can detect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
