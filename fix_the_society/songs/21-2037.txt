Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
