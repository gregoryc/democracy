Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
