VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
An open conversation, they always divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
The state of science is, wholly inert

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and moaning like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
