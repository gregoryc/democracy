Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
