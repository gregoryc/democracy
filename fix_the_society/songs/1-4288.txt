Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Reason is what they want to discard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
