Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Stop this already, time to get rid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Science is  fundamentally inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

An open conversation, they always divert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
