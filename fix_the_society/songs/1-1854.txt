Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
I must speak here, I must interject

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
An open conversation, they always divert
The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

The society is the ones who hurt
They do junk, they do dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
