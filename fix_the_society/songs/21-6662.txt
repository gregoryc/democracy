Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
