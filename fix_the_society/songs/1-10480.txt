VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
