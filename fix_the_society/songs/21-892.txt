Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
