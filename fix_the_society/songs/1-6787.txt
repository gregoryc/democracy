Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

An open conversation, they always divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

An open conversation, they always divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
