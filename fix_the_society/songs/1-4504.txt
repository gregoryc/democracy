Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

CHORUS

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
