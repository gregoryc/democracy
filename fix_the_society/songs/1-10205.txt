Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
