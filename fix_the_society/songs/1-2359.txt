Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
