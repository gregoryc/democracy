Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
