Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
