Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
