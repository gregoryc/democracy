Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
