Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

VERSE

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

This is not right, this is completely incorrect

VERSE

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
