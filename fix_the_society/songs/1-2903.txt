Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

An open conversation, they always divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
