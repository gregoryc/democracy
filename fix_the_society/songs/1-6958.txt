Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
