Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
