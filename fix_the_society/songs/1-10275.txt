Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
