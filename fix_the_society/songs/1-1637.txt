Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, they completely neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This is wholesale, in every aspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, they completely neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, they completely neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
