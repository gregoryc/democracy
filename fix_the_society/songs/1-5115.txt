Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
