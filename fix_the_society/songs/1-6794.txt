Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
I must speak here, I must interject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
I must speak here, I must interject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
I must speak here, I must interject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
