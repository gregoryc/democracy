Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
