Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

The state of science is, wholly inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
No one will be unhurt

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

The state of science is, wholly inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
