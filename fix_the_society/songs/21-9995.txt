Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
