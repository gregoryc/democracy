Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
