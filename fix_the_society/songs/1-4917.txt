VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
