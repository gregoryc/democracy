Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
