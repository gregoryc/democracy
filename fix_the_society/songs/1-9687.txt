Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
An open conversation, they always divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
