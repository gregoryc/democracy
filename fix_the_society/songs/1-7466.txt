Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
