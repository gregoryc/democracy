Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
