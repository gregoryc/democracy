Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
I must speak here, I must interject
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
