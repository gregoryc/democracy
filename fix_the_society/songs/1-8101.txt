Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
I must speak here, I must interject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
