Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
