Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
