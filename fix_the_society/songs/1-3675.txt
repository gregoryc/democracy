Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They do junk, they do dirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
