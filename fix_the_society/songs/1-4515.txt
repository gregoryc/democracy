VERSE

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

The state of science is, wholly inert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is obvious, anyone can detect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

The state of science is, wholly inert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

The state of science is, wholly inert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
