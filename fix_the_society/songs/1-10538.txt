Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is obvious, anyone can detect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

CHORUS

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
