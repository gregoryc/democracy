Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
