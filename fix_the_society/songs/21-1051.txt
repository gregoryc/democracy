Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
