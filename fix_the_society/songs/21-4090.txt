Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
