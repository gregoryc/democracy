VERSE

No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
