Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

CHORUS

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
