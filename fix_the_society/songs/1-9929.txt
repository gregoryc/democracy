Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
