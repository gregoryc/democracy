VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
