VERSE

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
