Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
