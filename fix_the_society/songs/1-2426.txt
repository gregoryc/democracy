Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
