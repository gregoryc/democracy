Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
