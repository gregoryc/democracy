Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
