Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The society itself, they completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

Whining and complaining like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

VERSE

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
