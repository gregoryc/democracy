Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The state of science is, wholly inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

If you talk to them they miss the subject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
