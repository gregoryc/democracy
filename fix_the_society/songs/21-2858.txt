Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
