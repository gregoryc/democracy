Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
