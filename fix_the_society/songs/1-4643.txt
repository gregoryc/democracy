Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is obvious, anyone can detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
