Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
