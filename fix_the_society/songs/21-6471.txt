Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
