Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
