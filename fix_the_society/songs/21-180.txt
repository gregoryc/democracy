Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
