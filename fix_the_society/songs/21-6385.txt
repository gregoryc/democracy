Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
