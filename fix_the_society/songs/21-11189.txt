Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Among their insular cliques they congregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
