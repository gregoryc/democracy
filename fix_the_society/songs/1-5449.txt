Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They do junk, they do dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
