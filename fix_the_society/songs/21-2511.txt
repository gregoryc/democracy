Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
