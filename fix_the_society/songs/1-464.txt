Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Don't want to test, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
