Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
