Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They do junk, they do dirt
An open conversation, they always divert

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
