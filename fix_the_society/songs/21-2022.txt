Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
