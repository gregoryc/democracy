VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
