Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
