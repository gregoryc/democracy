Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
