Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They make broad claims while acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They make broad claims while acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
