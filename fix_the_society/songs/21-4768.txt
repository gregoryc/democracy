Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
