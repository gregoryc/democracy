Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
