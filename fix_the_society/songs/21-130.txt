Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
