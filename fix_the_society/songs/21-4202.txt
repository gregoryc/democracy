Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
