Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Away from the truth they hid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They make broad claims while looking like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
