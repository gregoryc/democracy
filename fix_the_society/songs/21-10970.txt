Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
