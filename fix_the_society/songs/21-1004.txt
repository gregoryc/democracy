Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
