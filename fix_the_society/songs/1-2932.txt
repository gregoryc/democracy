Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
I must speak here, I must interject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
