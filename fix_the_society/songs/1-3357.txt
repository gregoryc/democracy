Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

This is too insidious for many to detect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
