Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

VERSE

The state of science is, wholly inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

No one will be unhurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
