Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
