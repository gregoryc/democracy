Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS
