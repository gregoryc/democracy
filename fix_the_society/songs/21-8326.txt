Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
