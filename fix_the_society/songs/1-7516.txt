Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
