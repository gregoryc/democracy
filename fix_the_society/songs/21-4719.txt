Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
