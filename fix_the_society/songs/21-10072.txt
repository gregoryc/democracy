Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
