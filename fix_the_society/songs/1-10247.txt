Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

CHORUS

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
