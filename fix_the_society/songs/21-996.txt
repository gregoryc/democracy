Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
