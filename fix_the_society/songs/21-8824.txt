Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
