Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
