Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
