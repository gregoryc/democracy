Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
