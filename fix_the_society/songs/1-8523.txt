VERSE

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Away from the truth they hid

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
