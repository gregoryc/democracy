Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
