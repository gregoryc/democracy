Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
