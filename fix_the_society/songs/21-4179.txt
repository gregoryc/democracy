Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
