Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
