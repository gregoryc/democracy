Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
