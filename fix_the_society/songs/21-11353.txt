Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
