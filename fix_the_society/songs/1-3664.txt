Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

CHORUS

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
