Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
