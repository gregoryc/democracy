Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is plain, anyone can detect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
