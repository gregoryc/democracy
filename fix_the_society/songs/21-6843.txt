Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
