VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
