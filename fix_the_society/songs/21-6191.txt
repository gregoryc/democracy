Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
