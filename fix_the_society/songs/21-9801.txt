Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
