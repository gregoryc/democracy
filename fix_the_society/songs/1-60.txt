Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
