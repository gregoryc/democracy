Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
