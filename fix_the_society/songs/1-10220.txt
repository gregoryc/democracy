Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, you completely neglect

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, you completely neglect

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
