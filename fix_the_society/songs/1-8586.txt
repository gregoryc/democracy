Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Away from the truth they hid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
