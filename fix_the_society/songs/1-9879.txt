Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Their own principles are something they do not respect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
