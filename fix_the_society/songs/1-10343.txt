Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

You don't think, they act like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

The society itself, you completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
