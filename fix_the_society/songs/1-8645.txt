Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Reason is what they want to discard

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
