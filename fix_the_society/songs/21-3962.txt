Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
