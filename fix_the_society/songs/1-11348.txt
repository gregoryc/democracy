Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
