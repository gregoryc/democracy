Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
