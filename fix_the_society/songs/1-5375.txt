Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Not talking isn't going to divert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
