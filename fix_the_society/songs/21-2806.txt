Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
