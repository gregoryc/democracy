Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

You don't think, they act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
