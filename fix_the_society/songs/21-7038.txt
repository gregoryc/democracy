Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
