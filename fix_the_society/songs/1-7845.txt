Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
