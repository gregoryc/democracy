Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
