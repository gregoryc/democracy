Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
