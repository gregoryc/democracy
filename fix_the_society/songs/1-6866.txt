Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
