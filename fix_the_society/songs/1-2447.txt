Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
An open conversation, they always divert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
