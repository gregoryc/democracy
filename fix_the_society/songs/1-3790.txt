Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Whining and moaning like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
