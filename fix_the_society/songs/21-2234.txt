Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
