Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
