Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is plain, anyone can detect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid

Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid

Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid

Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid

Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
