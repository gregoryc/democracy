Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
