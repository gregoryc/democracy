Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The society itself, they completely neglect

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
