Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
