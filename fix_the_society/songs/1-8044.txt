Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They make broad claims while acting like a kid

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
