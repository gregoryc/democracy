Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
