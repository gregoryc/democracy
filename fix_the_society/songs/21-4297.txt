Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
