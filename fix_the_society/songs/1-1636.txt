Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, they completely neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Don't have to do with ego or id
You don't think, you act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
