Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
