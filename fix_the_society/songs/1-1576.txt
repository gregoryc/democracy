Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

VERSE

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
