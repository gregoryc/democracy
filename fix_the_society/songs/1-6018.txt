Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
