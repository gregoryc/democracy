Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
