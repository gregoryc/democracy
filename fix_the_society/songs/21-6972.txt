Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
