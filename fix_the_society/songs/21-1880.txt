Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
