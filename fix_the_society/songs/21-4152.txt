Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
