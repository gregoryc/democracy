Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

VERSE

They do junk, they do dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
