Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
