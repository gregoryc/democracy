Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
