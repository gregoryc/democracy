Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Not talking isn't going to divert

Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Not talking isn't going to divert

Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Not talking isn't going to divert

Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
