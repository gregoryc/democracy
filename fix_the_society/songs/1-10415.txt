VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
