Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, you completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
