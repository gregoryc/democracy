Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
