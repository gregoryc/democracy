Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

CHORUS

This is too insidious for many to detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
