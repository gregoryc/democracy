Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

The state of science is, wholly inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
