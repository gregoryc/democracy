Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
