Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
