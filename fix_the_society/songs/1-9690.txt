Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The state of science is, wholly inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
