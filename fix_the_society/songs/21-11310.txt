Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
