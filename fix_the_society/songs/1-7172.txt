Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
They do junk, they do dirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Reason is what they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
