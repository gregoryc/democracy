Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't think, you act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
