Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
