Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Inert science they consecrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
