Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
