Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
