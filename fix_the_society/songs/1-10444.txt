Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The society itself, they completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
I must speak here, I must interject

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
