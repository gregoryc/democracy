Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
