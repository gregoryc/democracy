Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
