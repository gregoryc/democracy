Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
