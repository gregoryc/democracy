Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You don't think, they act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

CHORUS

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
