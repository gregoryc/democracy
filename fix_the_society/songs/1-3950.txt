Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This is too insidious for many to detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Away from the truth they hid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
