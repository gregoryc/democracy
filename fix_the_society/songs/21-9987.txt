Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
