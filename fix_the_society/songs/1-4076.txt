Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

CHORUS

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is too insidious for many to detect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
