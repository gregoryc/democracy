Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
