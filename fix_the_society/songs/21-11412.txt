Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
