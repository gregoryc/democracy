Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
