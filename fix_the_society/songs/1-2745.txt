Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

The society itself, you completely neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is too insidious for many to detect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
