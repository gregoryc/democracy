Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
