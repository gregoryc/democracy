Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They do junk, they do dirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
