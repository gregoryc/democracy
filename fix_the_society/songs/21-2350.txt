Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
