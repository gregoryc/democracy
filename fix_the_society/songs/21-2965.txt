Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
