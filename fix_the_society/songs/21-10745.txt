Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
