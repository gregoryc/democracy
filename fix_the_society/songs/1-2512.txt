Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
