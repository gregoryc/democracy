Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
