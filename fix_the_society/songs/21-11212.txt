Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
