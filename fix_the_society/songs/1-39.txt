Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
