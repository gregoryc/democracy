Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
