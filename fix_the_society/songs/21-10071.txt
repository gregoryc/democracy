Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
