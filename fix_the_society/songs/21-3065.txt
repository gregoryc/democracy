Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
