Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
