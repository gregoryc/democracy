Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
