Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
