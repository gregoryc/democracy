Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS
