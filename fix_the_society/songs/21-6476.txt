Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
