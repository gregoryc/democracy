Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
You don't think, they act like a kid

CHORUS

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
