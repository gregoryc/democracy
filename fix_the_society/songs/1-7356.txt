Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
