Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
