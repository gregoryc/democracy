Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
