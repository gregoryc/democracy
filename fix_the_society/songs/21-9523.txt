Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
