Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
I must speak here, I must interject

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
