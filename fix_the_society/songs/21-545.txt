Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
