Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
