VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

CHORUS

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Science is  fundamentally inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
