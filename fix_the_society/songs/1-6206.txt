Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

I must speak here, I must interject
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is too insidious for many to detect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, they completely neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
I must speak here, I must interject
