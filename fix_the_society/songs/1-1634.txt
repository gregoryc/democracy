Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their minds, they cannot exert

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Reason is what they want to discard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
