Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
