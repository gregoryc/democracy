Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
