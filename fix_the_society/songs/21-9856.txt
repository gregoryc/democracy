Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
