Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
