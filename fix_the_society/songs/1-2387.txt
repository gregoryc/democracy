Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
