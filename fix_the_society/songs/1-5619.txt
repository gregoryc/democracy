Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

This is plain, anyone can detect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
