VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, you completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
