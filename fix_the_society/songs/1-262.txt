Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
