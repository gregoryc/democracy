Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
