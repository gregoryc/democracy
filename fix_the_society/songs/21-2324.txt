Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
