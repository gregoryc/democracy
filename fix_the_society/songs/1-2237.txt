Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
I must speak here, I must interject

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
