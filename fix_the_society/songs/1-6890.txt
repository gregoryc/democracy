Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
