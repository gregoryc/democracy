Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

VERSE

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
I must speak here, I must interject

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
