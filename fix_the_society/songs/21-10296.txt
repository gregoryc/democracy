Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
