Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

VERSE

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

VERSE

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
