Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
