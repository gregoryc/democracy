VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
