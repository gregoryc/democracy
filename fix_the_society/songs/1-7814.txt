Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
