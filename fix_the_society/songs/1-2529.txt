Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
I must speak here, I must interject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
