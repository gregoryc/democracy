Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
