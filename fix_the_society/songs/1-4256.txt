Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
