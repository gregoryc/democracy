Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The state of science is, wholly inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You don't think, you act like a kid

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
