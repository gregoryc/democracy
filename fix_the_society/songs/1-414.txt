Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
