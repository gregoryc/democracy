Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They make broad statements while behaving like a kid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
