Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
