Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
