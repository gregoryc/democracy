Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
