Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
