Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
