Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
An open conversation, they always divert

CHORUS

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
I must speak here, I must interject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
