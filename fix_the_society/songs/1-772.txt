Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
