Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
