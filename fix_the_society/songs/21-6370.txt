Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
