Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

This is plain, anyone can detect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
