Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
An open conversation, they always divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
