Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
