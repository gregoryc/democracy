Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
