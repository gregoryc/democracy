Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
