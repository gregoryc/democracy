Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

CHORUS

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and complaining like a kid

CHORUS

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
