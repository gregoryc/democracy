Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
