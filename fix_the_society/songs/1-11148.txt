Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

CHORUS

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
