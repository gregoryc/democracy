Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, you completely neglect
