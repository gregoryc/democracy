Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

CHORUS

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They do junk, they do dirt

The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

CHORUS

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
