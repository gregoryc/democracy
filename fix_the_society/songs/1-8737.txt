Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
