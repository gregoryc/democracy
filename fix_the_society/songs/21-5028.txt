Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
