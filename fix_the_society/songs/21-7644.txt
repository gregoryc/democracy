Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
