Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
