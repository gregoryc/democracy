VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They walk down the Loser boulevard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
