Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is plain, anyone can detect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

CHORUS

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard

The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They make broad claims while looking like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
