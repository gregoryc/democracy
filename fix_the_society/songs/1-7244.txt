Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

An open conversation, they always divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

Evading conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
