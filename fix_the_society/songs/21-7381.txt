Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
