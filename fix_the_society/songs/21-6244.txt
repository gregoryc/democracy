Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
