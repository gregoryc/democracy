Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Destruction and doom is what they architect

An open conversation, they always divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
