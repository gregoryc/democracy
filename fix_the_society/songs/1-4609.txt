Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
