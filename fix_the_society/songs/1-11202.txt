Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
