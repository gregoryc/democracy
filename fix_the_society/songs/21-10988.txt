Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
