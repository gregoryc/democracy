Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
