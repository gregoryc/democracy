Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
