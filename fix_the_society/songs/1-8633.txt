Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

An open conversation, they always divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
