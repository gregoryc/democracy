Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
