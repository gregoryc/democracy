Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

CHORUS

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
