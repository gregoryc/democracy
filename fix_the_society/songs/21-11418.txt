Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS
