Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
