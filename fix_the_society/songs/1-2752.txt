Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
An open conversation, they always divert
They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
An open conversation, they always divert
They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
An open conversation, they always divert
They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The state of science is, wholly inert

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
An open conversation, they always divert
They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
