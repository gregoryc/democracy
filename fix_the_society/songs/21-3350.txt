Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
