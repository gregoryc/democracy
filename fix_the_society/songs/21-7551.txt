Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
