Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
