Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
