Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
