Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
