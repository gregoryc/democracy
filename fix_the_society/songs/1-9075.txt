Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The society itself, they completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
No one will be unhurt

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
No one will be unhurt

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
