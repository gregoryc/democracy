Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
