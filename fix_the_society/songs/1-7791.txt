Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

VERSE

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
