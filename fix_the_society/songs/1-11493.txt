Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The state of science is, wholly inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

All with their clique, eating their dessert
They do junk, they do dirt
An open conversation, they always divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
