Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
