Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
