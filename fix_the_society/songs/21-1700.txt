Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
