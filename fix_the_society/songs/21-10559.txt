Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
