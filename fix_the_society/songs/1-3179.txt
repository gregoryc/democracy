Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
