Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
