Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
