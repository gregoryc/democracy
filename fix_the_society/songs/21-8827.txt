Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
