Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
