Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Their own principles are something they do not respect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Their own principles are something they do not respect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Their own principles are something they do not respect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Their own principles are something they do not respect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
