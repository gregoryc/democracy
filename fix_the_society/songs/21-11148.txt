Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
