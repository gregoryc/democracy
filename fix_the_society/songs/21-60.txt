Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
