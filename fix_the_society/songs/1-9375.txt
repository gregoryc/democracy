Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
They make broad statements while behaving like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
