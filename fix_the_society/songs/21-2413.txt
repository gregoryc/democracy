Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
