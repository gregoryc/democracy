Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

I must speak here, I must interject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

I must speak here, I must interject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

I must speak here, I must interject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
