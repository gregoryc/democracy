Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
