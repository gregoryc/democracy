Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Their minds, they cannot exert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
