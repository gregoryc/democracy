Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
