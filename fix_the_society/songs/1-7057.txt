Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
I must speak here, I must interject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
I must speak here, I must interject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
I must speak here, I must interject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
