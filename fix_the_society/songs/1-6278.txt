Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave
