Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Don't want to test, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
