Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They do junk, they do dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
