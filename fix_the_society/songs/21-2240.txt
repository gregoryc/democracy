Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
