Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
