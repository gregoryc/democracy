Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
