Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Any novelty, they have disregarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
