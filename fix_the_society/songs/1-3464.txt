VERSE

Reason is what they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
