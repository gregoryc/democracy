Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
