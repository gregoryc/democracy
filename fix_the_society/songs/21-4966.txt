Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
