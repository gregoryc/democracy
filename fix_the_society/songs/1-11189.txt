VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
An open conversation, they always divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
