Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
I must speak here, I must interject

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
