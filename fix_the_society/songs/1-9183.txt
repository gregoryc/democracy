Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
