Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
An open conversation, they always divert

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, they completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

CHORUS

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, you completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
