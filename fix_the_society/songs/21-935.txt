Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
