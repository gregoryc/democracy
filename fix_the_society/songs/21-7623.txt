Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
