VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
I must speak here, I must interject
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
