Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This is too insidious for many to detect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
