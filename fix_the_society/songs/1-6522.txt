Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

An open conversation, they always divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
I must speak here, I must interject

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
