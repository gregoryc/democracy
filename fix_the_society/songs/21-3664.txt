Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
