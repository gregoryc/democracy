Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Not talking isn't going to divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Not talking isn't going to divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Their own principles are something they do not respect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Not talking isn't going to divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Not talking isn't going to divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
