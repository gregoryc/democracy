Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
