Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
