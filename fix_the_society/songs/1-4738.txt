Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

No one will be unhurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
