Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
