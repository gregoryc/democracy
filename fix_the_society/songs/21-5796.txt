Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
