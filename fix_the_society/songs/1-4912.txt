Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
