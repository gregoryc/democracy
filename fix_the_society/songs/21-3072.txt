Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
