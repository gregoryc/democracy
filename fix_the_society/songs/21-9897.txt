Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
