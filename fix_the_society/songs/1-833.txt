Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
