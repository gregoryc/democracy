Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
They do junk, they do dirt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They make broad claims while acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They make broad claims while acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
