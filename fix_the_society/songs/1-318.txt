Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
