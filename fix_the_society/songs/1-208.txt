Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
