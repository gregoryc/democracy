Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They do junk, they do dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

I must speak here, I must interject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

CHORUS

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
I must speak here, I must interject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
I must speak here, I must interject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They can't alter anything, they are inert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
