Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their behavior makes them charred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and moaning like a kid

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
