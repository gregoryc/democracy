Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
