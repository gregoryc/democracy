Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
