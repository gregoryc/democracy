Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
