Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is plain, anyone can detect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They can't alter anything, they are inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt
