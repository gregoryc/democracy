Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Whining and crying like a kid

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
