Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their behavior makes them charred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is too insidious for many to detect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
