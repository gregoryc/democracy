Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
