Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
The society is the ones who hurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

CHORUS

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
