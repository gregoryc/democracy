Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
