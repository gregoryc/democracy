Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
