Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Whining and complaining like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
