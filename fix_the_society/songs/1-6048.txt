Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
