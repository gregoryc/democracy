Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
