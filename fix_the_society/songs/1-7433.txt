Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
I must speak here, I must interject
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
