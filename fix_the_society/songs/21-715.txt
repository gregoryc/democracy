Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
