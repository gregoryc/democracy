Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
