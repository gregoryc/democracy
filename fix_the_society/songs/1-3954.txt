Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The society itself, they completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
