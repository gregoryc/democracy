Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
