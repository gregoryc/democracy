Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
