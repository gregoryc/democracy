Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
