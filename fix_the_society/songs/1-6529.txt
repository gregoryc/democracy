Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
