Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
