Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
