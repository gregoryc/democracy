Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

An open conversation, they always divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
