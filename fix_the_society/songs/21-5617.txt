Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
