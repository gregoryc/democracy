Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They hate themselves, they do not respect

Away from the truth they hid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

CHORUS

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
