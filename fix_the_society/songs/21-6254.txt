Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
