Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
The state of science is, wholly inert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
