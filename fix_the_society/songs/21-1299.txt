Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
