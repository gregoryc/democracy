Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
