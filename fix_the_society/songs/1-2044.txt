Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They make broad claims while acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
