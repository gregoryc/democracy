Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

VERSE

An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
