Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
