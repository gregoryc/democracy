Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't want to test, act just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

The society itself, you completely neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is obvious, anyone can detect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
