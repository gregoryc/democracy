Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
