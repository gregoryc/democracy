Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
