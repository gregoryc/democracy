Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, they completely neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
