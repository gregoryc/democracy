Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
