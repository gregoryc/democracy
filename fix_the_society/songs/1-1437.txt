VERSE

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The society itself, you completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
