Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
