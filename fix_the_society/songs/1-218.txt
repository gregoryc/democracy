Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their behavior makes them charred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
