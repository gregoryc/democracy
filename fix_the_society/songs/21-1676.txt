Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
