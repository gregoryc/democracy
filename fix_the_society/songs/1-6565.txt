Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
