Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
