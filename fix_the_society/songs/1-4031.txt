Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
