VERSE

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

The society is the ones who hurt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Not talking isn't going to divert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Science is  fundamentally inert
