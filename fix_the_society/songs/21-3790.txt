Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
