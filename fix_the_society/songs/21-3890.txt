Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
