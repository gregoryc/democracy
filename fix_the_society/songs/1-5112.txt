Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
