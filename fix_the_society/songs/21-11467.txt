Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
