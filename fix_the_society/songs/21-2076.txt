Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
