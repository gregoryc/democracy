Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't alter anything, they are inert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
