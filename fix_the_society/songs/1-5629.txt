Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
