Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
