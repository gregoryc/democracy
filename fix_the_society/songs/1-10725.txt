Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
