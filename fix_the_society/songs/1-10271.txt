Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

The society itself, they completely neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Away from the truth they hid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

VERSE

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
