Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
