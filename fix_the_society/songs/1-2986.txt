Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
