Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
