Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
I must speak here, I must interject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to test, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

VERSE

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
