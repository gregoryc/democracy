Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
