Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
An open conversation, they always divert

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
An open conversation, they always divert

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
