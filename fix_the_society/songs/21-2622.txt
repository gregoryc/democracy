Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
