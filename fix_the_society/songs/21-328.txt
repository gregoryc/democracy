Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
