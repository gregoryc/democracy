Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

VERSE

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
