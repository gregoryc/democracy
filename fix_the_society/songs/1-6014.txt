Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They make broad statements while acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
