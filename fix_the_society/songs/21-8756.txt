Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
