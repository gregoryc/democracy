VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The society itself, they completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
