Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
