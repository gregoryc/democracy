Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
