Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Reason is what they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Reason is what they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
