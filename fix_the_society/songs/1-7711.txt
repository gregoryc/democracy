Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They do junk, they do dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
