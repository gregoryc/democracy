Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
