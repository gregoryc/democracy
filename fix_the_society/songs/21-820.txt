Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
