Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
No one will be unhurt
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

CHORUS

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
