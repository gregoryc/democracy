Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
