Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
