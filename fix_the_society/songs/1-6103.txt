Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
