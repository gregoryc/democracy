Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

The society itself, they completely neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
