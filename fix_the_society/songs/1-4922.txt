Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
