Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

CHORUS

They can't alter anything, they are inert
They do junk, they do dirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

They can't alter anything, they are inert
They do junk, they do dirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Reason is what they want to discard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
