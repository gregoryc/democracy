Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
