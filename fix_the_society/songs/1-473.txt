Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You make broad statements while looking like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They make broad statements while looking like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They make broad statements while looking like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
