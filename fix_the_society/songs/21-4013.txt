Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
