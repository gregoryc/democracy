Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
