Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Away from the truth they hid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Away from the truth they hid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
