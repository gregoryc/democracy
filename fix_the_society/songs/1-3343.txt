Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

An open conversation, they always divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, you completely neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

An open conversation, they always divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, you completely neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

An open conversation, they always divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Evading conversation just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

CHORUS

An open conversation, they always divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, you completely neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
