Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
