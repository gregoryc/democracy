Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
