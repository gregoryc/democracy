Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
