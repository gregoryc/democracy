Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
