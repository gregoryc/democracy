Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
An open conversation, they always divert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
