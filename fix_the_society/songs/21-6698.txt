Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
