Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
