Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
