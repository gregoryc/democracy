Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
