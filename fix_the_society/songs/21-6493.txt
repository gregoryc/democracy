Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
