Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
