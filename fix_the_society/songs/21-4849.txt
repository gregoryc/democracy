Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
