Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
