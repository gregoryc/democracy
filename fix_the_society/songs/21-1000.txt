Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
