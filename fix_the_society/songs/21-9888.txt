Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
