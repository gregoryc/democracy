Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
