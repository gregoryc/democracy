Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
