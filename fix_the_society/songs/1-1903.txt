Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

CHORUS

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
