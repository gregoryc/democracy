Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You don't think, they act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You don't think, they act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

VERSE

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They do junk, they do dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You don't think, they act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
