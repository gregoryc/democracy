Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
