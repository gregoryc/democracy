Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Not talking isn't going to divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

They can't alter anything, they are inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
