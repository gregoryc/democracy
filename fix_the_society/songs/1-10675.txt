Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The society itself, they completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
