Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They make broad claims while looking like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
