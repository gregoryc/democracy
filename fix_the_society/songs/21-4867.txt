Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
