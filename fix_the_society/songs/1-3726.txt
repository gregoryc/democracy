Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
