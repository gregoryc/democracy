Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
