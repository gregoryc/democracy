VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

The society itself, you completely neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
