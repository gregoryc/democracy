Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

CHORUS

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

CHORUS

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
