Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
