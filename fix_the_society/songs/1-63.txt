Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
