Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

The society is the ones who hurt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
An open conversation, they always divert
