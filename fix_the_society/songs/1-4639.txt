Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

The society is the ones who hurt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
