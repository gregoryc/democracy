Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Science is  fundamentally inert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They do junk, they do dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They do junk, they do dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
