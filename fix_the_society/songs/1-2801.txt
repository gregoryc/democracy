Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They make broad claims while acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
