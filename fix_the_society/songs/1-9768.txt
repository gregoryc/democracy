Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Whining and crying like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
