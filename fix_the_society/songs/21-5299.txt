Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
