Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
