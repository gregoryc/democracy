Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
