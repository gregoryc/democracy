Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

CHORUS

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

CHORUS

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
