Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Not talking isn't going to divert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
