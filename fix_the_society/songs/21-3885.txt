Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
