Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
