Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is obvious, anyone can detect

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave
