Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
