Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
