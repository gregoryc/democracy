Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
