Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
