Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
