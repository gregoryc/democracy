Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Away from the truth they hid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, they completely neglect
