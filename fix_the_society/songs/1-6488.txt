Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
