Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
