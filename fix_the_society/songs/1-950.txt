Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
