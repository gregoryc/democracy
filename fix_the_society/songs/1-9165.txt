Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
