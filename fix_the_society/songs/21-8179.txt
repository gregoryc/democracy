Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Among their insular cliques they congregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
