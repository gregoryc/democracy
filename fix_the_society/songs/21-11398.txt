Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
