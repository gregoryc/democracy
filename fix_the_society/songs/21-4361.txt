Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
