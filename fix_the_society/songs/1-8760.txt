Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

CHORUS

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Reason is what they want to discard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
