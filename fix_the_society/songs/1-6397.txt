Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
