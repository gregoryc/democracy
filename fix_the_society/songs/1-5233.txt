Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
