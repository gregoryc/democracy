Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
