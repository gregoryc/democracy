Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
