Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is too insidious for many to detect
I must speak here, I must interject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
