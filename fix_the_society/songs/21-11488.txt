Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
