Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
