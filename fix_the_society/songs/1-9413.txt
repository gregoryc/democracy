Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Not talking isn't going to divert
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
