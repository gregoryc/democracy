Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

I must speak here, I must interject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They can't alter anything, they are inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
