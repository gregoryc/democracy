VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is too insidious for many to detect

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
An open conversation, they always divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
