Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
