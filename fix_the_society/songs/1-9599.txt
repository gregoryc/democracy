VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
An open conversation, they always divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
