Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
