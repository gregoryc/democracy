Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
I must speak here, I must interject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
