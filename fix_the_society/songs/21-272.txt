Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
