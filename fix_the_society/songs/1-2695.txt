Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
