Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
