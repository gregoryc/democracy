Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
