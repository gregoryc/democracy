Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
