Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and crying like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They make broad statements while looking like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
