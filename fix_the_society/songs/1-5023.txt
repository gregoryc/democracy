Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
