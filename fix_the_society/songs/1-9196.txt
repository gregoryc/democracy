Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
