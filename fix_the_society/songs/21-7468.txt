Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
