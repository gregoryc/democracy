Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
