Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
