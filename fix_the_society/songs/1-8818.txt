Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
