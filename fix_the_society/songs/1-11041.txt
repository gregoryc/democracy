Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
