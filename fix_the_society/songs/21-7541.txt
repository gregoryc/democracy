Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
