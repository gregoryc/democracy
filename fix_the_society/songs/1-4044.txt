Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
