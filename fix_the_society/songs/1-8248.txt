Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Science is  fundamentally inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Science is  fundamentally inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Science is  fundamentally inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
