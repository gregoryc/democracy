VERSE

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is obvious, anyone can detect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
