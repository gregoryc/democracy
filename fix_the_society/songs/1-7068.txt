Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They don't think, they act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

This is too insidious for many to detect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
