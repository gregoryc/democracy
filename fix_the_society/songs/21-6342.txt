Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Inert science they consecrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
