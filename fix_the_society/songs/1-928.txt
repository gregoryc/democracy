Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is obvious, anyone can detect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

VERSE

An open conversation, they always divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
