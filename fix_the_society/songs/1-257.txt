Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, they completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
