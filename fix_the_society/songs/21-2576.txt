Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
