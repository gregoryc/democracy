Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
