Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
