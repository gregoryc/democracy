Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
