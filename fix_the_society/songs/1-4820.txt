Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
