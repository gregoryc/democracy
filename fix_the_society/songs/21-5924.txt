Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Ho-ho-ho, hohum

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
