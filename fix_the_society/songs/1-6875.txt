Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
