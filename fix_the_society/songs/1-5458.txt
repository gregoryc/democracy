Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is too insidious for many to detect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
