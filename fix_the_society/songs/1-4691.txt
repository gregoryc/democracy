Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't think, you act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
