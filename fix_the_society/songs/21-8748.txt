Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
