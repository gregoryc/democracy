Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
