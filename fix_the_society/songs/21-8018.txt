Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
