Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
