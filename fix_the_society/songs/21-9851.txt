Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
