Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
