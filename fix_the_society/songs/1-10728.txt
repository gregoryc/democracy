Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

You make broad claims while looking like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is obvious, anyone can detect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
