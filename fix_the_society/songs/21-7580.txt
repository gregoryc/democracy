Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
