Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
