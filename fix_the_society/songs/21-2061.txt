Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
