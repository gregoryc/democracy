Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
