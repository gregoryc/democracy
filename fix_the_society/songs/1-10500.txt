Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
