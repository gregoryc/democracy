Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
