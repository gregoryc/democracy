Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
