Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Away from the truth they hid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
