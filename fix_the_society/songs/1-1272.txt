Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Their minds, they cannot exert
They do junk, they do dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The state of science is, wholly inert

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
