Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
