Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
