Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, you completely neglect

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
