Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
