Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
