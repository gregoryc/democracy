Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
