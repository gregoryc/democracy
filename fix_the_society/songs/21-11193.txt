Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
