Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They do junk, they do dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
