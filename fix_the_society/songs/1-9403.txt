Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

I must speak here, I must interject
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
