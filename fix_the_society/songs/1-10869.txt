Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
