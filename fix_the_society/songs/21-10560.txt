Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
