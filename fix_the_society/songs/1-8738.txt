Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
