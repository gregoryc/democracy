Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
