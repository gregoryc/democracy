Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

Inert science they consecrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
