Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
