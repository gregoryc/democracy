Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
