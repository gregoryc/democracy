Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Not talking isn't going to divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
