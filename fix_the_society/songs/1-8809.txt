Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Not talking isn't going to divert

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
