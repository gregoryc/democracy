Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They do junk, they do dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
