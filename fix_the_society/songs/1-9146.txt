Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
