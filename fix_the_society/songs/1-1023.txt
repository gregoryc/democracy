Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't think, they act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
