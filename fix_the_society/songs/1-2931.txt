Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
I must speak here, I must interject
