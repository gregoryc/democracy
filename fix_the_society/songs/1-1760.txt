Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
