Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

I must speak here, I must interject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
