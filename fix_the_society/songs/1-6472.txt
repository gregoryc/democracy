Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
