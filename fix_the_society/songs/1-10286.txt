Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They do junk, they do dirt

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

CHORUS

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Evading conversation just like a kid

Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
