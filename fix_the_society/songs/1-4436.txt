Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
