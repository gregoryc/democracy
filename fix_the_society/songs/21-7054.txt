Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
