Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
