Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

Inert science they consecrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

Inert science they consecrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Inert science they consecrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
