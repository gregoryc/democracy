Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
