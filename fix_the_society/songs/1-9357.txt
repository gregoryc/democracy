Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
I must speak here, I must interject

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
