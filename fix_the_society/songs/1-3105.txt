Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Away from the truth they hid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
