Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
