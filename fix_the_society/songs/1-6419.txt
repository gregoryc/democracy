Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
