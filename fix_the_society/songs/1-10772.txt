Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
