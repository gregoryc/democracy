Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt

Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
