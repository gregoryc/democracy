Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
