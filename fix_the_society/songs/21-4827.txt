Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
