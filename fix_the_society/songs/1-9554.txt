Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
An open conversation, they always divert

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
