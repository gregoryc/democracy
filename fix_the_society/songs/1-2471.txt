Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
