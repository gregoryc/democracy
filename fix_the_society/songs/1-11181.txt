Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
