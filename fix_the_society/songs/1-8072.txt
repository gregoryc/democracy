Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
