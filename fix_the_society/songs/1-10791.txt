Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
