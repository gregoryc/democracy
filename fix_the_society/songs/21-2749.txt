Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
