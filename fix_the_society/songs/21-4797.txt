Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
