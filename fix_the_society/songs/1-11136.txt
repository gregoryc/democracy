Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
The state of science is, wholly inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
