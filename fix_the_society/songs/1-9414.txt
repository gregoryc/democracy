Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is plain, anyone can detect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

VERSE

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

I must speak here, I must interject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
