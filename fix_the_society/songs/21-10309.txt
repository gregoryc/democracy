Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
