Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
