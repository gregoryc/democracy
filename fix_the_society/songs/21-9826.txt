Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
