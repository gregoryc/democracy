Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
