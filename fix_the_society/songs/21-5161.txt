Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
