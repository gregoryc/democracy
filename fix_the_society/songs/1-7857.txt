Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

CHORUS

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
