Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Whining and crying like a kid
