Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
