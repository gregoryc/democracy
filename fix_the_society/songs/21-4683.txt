Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
