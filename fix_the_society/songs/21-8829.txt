Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
