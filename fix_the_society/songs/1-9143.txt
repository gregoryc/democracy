Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Science is  fundamentally inert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
Not talking isn't going to divert

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They do junk, they do dirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
