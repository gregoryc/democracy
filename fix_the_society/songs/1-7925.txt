VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
No one will be unhurt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave
