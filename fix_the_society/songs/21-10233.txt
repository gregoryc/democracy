Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
