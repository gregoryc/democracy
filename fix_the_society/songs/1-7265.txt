Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
