Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Inert science they consecrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
