Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
