Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
