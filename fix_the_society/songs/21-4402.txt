Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
