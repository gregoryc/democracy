Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

An open conversation, they always divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
