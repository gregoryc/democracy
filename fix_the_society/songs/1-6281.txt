Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
An open conversation, they always divert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
