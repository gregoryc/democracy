Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
