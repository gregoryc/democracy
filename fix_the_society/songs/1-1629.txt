Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

CHORUS

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
