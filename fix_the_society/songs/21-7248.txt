Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
