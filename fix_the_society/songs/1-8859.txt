Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their own principles are something they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Don't have to do with ego or id
You don't think, you act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
No one will be unhurt

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
