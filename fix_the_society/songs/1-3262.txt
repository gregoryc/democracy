Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
