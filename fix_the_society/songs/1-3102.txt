Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
