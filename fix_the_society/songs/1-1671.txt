VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They do junk, they do dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The state of science is, wholly inert
