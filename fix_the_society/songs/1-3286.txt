Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They hate themselves, they do not respect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
