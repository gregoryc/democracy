VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Playing only the worst card

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
