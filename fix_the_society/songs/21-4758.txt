Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Inert science they consecrate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Inert science they consecrate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
