Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Inert science they consecrate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
