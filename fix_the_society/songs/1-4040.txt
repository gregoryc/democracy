Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You make broad statements while acting like a kid

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
