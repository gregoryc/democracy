Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Inert science they consecrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
