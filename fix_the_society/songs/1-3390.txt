Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, they completely neglect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
