Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They do junk, they do dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

CHORUS

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They do junk, they do dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
No one will be unhurt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

CHORUS

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They do junk, they do dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
