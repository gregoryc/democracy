Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They do junk, they do dirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
