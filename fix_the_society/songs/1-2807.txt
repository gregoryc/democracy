Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

If you talk to them they miss the subject
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

CHORUS

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, they completely neglect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
