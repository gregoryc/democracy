Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
