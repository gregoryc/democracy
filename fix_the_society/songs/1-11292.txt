VERSE

Running away from conversation just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

The society itself, you completely neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
