Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Ho-ho-ho, hohum

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
