Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
