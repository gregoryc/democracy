Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their minds, they cannot exert
The state of science is, wholly inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
