Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
