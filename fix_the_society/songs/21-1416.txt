Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
