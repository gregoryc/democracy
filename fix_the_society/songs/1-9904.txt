Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
