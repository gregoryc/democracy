Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
