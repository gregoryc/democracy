Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
