Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

VERSE

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
