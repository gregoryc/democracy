Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
