Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
