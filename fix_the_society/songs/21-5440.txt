Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
