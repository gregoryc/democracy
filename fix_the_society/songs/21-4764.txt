Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
