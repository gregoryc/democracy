Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their own principles are something they do not respect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
