Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
