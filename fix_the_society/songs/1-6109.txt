Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Reason is what they want to discard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
