Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

If you talk to them they miss the subject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
