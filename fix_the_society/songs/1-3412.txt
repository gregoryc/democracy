Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard

They hate themselves, they do not respect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Their minds, they cannot exert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
