Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Not talking isn't going to divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
