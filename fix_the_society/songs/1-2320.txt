Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You don't think, they act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
