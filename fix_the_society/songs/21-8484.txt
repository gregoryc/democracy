Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
