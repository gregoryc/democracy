Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
