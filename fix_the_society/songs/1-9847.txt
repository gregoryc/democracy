Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
