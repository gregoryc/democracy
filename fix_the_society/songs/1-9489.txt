Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
