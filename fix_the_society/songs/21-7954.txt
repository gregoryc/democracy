Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
