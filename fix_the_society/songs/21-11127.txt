Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
