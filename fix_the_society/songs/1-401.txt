Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
