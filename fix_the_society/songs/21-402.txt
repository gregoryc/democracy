Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
