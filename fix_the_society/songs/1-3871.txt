Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The society itself, you completely neglect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
