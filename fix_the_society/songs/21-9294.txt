Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
