Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
