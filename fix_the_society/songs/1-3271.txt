VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
