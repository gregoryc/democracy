Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
