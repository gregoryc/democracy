Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, they completely neglect

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and complaining like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, they completely neglect

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and complaining like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The state of science is, wholly inert

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is plain, anyone can detect
