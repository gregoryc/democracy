Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
