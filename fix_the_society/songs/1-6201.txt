Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
