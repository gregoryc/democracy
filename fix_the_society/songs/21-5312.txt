Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
