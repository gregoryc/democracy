Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

There should be no division, no need to be separate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
