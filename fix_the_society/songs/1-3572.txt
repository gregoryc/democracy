VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

No one will be unhurt
Science is  fundamentally inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

VERSE

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
