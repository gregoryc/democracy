Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
