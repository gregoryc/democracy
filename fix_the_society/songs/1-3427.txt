Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

They do junk, they do dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
