VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You don't think, they act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They do junk, they do dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
