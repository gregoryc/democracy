Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
