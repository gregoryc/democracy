Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
