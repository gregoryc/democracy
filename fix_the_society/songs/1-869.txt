Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
No one will be unhurt

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior makes them charred

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
