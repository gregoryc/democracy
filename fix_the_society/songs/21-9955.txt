Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
