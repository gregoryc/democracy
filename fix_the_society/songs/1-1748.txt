Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
