Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
