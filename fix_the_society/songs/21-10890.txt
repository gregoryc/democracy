Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
