Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
