Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
