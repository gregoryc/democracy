Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
