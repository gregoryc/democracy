Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid

Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

VERSE

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
The society is the ones who hurt
