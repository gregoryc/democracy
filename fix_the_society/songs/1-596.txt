Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
