Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The society itself, they completely neglect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
