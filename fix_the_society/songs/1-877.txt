VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
