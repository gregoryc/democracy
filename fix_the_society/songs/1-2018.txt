Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The society itself, you completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
