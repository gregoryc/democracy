VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
