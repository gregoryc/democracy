Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
