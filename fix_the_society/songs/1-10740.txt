Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
