Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
