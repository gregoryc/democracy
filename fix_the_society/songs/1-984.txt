Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

No one will be unhurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

No one will be unhurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard
