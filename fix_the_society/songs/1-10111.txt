Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Playing only the worst card
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
