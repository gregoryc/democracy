Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
