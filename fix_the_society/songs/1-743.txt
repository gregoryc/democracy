Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The society is the ones who hurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
