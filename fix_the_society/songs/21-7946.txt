Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
