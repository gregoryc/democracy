Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

CHORUS

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
