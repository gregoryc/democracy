Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
