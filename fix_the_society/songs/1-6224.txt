Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
