Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
