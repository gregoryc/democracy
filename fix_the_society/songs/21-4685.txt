Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
