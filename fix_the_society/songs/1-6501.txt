Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
