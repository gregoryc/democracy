Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
