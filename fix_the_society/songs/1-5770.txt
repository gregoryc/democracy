VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

This is plain, anyone can detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

This is plain, anyone can detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
