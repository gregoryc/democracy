Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
