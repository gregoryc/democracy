Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
