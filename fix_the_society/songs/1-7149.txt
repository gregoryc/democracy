Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
