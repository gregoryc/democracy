Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
