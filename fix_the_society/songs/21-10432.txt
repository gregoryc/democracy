Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
