Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Inert science they consecrate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Inert science they consecrate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Inert science they consecrate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
