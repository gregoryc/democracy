Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

This is too insidious for many to detect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

VERSE

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
