Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They make broad claims while acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
