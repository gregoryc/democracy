Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Not talking isn't going to divert

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, they completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
