Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
