Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
