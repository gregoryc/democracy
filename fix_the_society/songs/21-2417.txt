Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
