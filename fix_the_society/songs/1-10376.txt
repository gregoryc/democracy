Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
