Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
