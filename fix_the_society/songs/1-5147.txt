Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
