Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
