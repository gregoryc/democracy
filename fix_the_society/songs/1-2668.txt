Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
