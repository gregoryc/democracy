Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
