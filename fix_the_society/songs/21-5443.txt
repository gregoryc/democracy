Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
