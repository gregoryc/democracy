Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
