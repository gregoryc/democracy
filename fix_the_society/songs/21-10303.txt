Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
