Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
