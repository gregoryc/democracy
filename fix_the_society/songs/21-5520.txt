Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
