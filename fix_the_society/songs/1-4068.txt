Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They make broad statements while looking like a kid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
