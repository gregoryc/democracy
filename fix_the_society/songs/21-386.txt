Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
