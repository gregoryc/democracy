Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

CHORUS

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

VERSE

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
