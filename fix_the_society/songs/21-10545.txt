Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
