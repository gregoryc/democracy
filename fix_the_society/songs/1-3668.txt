Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Whining and moaning like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
