Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
