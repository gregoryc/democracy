Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Playing only the worst card
