Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

I must speak here, I must interject
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

I must speak here, I must interject
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They don't think, you act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

I must speak here, I must interject
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

VERSE

They make broad statements while acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

I must speak here, I must interject
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
