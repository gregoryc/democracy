Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
