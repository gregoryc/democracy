Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
I must speak here, I must interject

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

VERSE

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
