Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
