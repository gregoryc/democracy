Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Whining and complaining like a kid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
