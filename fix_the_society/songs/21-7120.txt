Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
