Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
