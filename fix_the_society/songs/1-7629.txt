Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Not talking isn't going to divert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Reason is what they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Reason is what they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
