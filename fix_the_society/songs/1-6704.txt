Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is plain, anyone can detect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
