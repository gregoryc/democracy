Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
