Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
