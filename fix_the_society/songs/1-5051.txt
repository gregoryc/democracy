VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
