Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt

CHORUS

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Science is  fundamentally inert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Reason is what they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
