Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and complaining like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
An open conversation, they always divert

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect

VERSE

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Their behavior makes them charred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
