Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
