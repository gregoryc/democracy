Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
I must speak here, I must interject

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is obvious, anyone can detect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
