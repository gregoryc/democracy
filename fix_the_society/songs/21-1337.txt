Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
