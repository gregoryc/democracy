Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
