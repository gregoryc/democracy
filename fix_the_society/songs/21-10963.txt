Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
