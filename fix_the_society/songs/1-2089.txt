Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This is too insidious for many to detect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
