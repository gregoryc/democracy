Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is plain, anyone can detect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
