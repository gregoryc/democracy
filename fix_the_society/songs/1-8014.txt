Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

CHORUS

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
