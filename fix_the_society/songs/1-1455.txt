Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You make broad statements while acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Reason is what they want to discard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Reason is what they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
