Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
