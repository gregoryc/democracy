Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
