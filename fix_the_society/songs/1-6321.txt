Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
