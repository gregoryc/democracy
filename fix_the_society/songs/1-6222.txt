Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
