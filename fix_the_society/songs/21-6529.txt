Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
