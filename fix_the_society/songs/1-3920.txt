Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

CHORUS

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
