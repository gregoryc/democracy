Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You don't think, you act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
