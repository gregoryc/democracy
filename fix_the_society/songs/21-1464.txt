Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
