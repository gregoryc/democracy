Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
An open conversation, they always divert

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
