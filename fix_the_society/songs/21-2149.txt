Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
