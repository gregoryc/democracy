Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They make broad statements while acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
