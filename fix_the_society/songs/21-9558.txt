Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
