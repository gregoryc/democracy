Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is too insidious for many to detect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is too insidious for many to detect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

This is too insidious for many to detect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
