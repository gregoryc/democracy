Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Not talking isn't going to divert
The state of science is, wholly inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

I must speak here, I must interject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
