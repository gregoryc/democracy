Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
An open conversation, they always divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
