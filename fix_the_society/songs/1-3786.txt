Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is too insidious for many to detect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

VERSE

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They hate themselves, they do not respect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
