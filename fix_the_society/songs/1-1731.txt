Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

An open conversation, they always divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They do junk, they do dirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

An open conversation, they always divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They do junk, they do dirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
