Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
