Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The society itself, you completely neglect

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
