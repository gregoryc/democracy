Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
