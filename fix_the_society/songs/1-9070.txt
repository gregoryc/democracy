VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You don't think, you act like a kid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
No one will be unhurt
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They do junk, they do dirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
