Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They do junk, they do dirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
