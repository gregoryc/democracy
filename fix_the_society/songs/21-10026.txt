Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
