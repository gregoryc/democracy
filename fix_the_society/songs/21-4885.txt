Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Inert science they consecrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
