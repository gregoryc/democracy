Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is plain, anyone can detect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

CHORUS

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is plain, anyone can detect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is plain, anyone can detect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is plain, anyone can detect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
