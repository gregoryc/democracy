VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
