Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
