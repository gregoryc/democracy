Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

VERSE

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
