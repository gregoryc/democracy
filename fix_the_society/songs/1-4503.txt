Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

No one will be unhurt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
