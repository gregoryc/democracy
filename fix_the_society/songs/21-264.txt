Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
