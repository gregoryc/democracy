Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
