Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
