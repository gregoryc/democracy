Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
