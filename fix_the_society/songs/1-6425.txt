Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their behavior makes them charred
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
