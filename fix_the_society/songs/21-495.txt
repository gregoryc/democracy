Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Things are not good, they are not alright

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
