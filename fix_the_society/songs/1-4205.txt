Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

CHORUS

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
