Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

This is wholesale, in every aspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

This is wholesale, in every aspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

This is wholesale, in every aspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
