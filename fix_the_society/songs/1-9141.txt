Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The society itself, you completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
