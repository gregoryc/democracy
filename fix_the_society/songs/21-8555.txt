Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
