Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
