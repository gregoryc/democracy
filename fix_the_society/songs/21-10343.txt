Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
