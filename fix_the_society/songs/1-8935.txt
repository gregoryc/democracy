Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
