Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
