Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

An open conversation, they always divert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
An open conversation, they always divert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

An open conversation, they always divert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

I must speak here, I must interject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
