Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
