Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
