Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
