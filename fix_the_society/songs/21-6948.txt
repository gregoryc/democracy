Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
