Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
