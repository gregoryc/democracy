Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
