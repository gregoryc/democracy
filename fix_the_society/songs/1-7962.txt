Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Their own principles are something they do not respect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
