Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Running away from conversation just like a kid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
