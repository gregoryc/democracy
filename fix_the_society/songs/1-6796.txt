Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
