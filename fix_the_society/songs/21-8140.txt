Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
