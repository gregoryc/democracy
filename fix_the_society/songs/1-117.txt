Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They make broad statements while looking like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
