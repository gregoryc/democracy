Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
