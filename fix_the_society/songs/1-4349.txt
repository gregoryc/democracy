Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is obvious, anyone can detect

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

CHORUS

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
