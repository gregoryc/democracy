Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
