Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

I must speak here, I must interject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
