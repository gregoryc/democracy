Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They make broad claims while behaving like a kid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
