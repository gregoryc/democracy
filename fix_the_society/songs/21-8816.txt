Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
