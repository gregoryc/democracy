Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
