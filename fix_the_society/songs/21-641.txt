Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
