Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
