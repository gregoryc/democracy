Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
