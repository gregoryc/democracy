Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
