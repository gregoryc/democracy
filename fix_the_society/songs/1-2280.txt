Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
