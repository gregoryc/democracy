Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Destruction and doom is what they architect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
