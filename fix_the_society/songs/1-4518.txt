Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
