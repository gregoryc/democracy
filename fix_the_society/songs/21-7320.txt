Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
