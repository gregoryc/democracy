Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

Among their insular cliques they congregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

Among their insular cliques they congregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
