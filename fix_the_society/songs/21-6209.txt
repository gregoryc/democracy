Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
