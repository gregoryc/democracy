Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
