Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
