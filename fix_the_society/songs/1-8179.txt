Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

The society itself, you completely neglect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

You make broad statements while looking like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
