Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
