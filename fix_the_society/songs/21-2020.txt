Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
