Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
