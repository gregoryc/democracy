Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
