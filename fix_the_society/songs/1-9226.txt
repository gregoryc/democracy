Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They hate themselves, they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
