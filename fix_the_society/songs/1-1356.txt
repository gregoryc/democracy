Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid

CHORUS

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
