Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
