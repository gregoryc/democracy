Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
