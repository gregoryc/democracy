Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Science is  fundamentally inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
