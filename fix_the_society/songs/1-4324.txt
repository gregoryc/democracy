Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
