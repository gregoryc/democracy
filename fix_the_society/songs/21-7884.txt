Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
