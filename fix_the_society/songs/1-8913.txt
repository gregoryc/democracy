Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

An open conversation, they always divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
