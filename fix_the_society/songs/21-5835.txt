Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
