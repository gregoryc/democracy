Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You don't think, you act like a kid

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
