Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Inert science they consecrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
