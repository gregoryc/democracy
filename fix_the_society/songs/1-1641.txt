Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
