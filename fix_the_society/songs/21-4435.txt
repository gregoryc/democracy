Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
