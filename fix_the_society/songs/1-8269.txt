VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
