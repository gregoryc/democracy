Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
