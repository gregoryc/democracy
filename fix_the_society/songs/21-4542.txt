Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Among their insular cliques they congregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
