Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
