Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
