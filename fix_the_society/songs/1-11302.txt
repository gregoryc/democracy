Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

VERSE

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
The truth is what they wish to disregard

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
