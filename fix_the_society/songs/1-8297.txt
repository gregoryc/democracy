Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
