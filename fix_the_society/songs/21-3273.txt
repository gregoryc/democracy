Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
