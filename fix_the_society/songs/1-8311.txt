Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
