Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
