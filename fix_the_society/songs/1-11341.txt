Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Evading conversation just like a kid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You don't think, you act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
