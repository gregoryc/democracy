Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Reason is what they want to discard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
