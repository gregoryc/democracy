VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

The society itself, you completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
