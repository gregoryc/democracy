Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
