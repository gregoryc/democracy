Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
