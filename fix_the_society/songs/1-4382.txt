Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Playing only the worst card
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
