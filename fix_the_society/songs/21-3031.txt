Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
