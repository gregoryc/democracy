Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
