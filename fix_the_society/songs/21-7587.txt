Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
