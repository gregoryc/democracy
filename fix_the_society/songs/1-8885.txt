Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
No one will be unhurt

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
No one will be unhurt

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
No one will be unhurt

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
