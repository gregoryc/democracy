Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
