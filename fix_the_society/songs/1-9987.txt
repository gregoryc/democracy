Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Playing only the worst card
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
