Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
I must speak here, I must interject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
