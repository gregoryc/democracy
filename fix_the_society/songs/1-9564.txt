Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
