Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The state of science is, wholly inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They do junk, they do dirt

The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
