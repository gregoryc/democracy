Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
