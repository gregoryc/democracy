Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
