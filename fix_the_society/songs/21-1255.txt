Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
