Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
