Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
