Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
