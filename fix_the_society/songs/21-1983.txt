Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
