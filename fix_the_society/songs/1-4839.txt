Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
