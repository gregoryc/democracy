Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
