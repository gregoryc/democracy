Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
