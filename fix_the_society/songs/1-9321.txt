Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is too insidious for many to detect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
