Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
