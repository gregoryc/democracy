Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
