Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
