Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
