Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
