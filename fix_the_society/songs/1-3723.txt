Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
