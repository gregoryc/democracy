Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
