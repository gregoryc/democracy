Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their minds, they cannot exert
The state of science is, wholly inert
An open conversation, they always divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
