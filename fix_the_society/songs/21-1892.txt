Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
