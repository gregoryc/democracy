Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
