Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
