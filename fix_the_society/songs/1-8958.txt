VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
No one will be unhurt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They do junk, they do dirt

Their own principles are something they do not respect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
