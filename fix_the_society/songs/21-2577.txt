Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
