Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

VERSE

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
