Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
