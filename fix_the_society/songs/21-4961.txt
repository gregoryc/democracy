Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
