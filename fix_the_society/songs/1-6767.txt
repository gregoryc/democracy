Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
The society itself, they completely neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
