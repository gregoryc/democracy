Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They hate themselves, they do not respect
I must speak here, I must interject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The society itself, you completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
They do junk, they do dirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
