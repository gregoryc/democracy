Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is too insidious for many to detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
