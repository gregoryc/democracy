Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
