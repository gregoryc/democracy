VERSE

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Destruction and doom is what they architect

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
