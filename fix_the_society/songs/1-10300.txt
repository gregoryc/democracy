Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They hate themselves, they do not respect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, you completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They hate themselves, they do not respect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, you completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
