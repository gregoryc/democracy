Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
