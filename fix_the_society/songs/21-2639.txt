Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
