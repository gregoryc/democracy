Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
