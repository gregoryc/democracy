Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
