Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
