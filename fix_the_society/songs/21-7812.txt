Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
