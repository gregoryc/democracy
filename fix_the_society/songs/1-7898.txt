Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

This is too insidious for many to detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
