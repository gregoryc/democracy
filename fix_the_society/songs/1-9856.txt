Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
