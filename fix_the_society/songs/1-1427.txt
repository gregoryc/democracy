Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Don't have to do with ego or id
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
