Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
