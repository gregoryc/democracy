Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
