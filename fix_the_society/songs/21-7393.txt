Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
