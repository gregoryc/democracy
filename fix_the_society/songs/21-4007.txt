Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
