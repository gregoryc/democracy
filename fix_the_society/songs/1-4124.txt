Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
