Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
