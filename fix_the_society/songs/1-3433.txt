Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
