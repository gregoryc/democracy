Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate
