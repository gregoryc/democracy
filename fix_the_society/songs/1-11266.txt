Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

They don't think, they act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

They don't think, they act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
