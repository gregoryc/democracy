Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
