Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

VERSE

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
