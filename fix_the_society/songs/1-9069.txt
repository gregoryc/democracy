Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, they completely neglect

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They do junk, they do dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Science is  fundamentally inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Not talking isn't going to divert
No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
