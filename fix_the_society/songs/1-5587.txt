Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

CHORUS

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The society is the ones who hurt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
