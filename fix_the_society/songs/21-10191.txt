Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
