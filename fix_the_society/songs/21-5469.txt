Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
