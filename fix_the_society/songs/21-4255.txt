Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
