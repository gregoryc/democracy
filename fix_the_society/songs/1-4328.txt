Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
