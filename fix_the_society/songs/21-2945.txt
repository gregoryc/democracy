Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
