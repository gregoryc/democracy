Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
