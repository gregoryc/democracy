Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
