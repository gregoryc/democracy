Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
