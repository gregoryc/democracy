Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, they completely neglect

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

You don't think, you act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Away from the truth they hid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
