Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
