Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

I must speak here, I must interject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Science is  fundamentally inert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

An open conversation, they always divert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
