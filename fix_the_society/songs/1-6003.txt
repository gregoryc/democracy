Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
I must speak here, I must interject
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

The society is the ones who hurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
I must speak here, I must interject
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

The society is the ones who hurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
I must speak here, I must interject
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

The society is the ones who hurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
