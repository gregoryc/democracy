Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
