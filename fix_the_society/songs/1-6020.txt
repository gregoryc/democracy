Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Not talking isn't going to divert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt
