Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
No one will be unhurt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
