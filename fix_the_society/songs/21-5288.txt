Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
