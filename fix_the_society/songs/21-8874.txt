Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
