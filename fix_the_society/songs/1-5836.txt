Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
