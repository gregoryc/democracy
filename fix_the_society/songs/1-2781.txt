Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
