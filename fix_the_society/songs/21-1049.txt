Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
