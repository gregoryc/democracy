Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
