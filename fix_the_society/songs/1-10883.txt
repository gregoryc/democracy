Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

I must speak here, I must interject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
