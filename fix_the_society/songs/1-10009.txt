Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
The society itself, you completely neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
The society itself, you completely neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
The society itself, you completely neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
