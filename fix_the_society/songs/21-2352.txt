Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
