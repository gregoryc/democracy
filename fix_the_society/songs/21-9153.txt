Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
