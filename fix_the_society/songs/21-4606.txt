Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
