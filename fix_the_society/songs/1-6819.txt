Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They don't think, you act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
