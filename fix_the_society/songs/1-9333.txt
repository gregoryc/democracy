Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
