Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
