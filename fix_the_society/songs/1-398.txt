Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Whining and complaining like a kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
