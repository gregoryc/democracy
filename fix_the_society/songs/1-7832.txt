Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
