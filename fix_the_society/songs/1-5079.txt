Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
