Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
