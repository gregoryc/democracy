Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
