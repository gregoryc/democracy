Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

VERSE

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
