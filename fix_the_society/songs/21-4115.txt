Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
