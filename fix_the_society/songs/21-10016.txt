Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
