Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
