Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Away from the truth they hid

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

They can't alter anything, they are inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
