Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
