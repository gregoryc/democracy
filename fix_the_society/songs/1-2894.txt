VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, you completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
I must speak here, I must interject

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, you completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
I must speak here, I must interject

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

Their ideas are narrow, they always select

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
I must speak here, I must interject

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
