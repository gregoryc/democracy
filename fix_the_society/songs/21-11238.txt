Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
