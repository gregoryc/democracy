Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
