Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Protesting your problems will make you best

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
