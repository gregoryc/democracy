Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
