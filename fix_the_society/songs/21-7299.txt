Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
