Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
