Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too insidious for many to detect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too insidious for many to detect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

VERSE

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
