Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Inert science they consecrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
