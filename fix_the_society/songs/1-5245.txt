Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The society itself, you completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
