Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
I must speak here, I must interject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
