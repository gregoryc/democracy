Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
