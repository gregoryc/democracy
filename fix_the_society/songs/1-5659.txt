Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

CHORUS

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
