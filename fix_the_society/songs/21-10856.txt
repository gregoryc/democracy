Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
