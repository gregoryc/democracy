Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
