VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
