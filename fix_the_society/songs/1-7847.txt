Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
