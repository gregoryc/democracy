Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

You don't think, you act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
