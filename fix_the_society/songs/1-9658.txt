Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
