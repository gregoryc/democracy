Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
