Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, you completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
