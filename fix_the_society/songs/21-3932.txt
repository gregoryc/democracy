Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
