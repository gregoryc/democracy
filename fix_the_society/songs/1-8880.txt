Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

An open conversation, they always divert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
