Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
