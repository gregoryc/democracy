Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
