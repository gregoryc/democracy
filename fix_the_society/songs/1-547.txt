VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
The society itself, you completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
