Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
