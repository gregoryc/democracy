Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
