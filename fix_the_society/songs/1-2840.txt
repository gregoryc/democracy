VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The state of science is, wholly inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
