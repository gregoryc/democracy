VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
I must speak here, I must interject

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
