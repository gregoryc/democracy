Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

CHORUS

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
