Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
