Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
