Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
