Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Reason is what they want to discard

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

VERSE

They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card

The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
