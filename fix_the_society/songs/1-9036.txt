Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
I must speak here, I must interject

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
