Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
