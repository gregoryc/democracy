Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Reason is what they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
