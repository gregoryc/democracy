Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
