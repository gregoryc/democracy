Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
