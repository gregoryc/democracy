Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
