Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
