Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
