Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
