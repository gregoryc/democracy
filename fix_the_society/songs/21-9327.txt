Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
