Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
