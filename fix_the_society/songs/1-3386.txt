Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
