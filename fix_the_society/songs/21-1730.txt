Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
