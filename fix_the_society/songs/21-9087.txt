Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
