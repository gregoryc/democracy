Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
