Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
