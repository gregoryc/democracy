Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
