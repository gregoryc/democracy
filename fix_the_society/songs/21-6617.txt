Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
