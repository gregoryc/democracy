Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
