Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
