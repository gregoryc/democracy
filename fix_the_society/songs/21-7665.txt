Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
