Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
