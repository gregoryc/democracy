Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
