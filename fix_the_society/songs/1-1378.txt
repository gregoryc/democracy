Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Whining and crying like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
The state of science is, wholly inert

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
I must speak here, I must interject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
