Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
