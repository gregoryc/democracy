Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
