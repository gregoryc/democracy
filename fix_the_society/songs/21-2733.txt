Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
