Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
