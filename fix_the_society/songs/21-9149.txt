Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
