Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
