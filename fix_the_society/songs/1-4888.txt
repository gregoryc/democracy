Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
I must speak here, I must interject
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
