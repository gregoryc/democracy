Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
An open conversation, they always divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
An open conversation, they always divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
An open conversation, they always divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Reason is what they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
