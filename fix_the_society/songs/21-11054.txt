Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
