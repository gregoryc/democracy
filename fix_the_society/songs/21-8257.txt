Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
