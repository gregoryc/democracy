Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
