Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
