Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
