Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They can't alter anything, they are inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

It is so rude, I just need to diss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
