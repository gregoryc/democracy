Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
