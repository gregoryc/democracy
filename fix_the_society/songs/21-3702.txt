Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
