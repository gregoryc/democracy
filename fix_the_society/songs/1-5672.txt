VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
