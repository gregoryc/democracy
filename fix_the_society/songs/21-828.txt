Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
