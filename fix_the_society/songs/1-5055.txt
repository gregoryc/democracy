Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
You don't think, they act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
You don't think, they act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
You don't think, they act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
