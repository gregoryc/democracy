Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
