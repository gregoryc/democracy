Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
