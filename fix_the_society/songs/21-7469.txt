Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
