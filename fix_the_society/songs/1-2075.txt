Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Whining and moaning like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
