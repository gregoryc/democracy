Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
