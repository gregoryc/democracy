Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
