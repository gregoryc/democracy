Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Protesting your problems will make you best

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
