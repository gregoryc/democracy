Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
