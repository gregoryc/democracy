Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is too insidious for many to detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They make broad statements while looking like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
