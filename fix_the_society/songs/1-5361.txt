Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is too insidious for many to detect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
