Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
