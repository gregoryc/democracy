Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
An open conversation, they always divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
