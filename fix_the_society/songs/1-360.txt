Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
