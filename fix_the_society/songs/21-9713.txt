Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
