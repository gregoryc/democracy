Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
