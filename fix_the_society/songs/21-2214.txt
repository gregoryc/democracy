Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
