Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

I must speak here, I must interject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't think, they act like a kid

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
