Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

VERSE

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
