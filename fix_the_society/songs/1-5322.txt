Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

The society itself, you completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any novel idea, they want to discard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
