Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
