Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
