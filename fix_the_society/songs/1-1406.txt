VERSE

They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Evading conversation just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
