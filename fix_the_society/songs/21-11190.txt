Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
