Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to test, act just like a kid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
