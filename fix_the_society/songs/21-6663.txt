Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
