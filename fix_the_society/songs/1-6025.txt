Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Science is  fundamentally inert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
