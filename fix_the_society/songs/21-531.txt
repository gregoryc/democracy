Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
