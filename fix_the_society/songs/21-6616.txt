Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
