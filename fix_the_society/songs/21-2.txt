Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
