Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The society itself, you completely neglect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
