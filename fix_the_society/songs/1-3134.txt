Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They make broad claims while looking like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't think, they act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

CHORUS

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't think, they act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
