Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
