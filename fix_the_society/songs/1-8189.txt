Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

If you talk to them they miss the subject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The state of science is, wholly inert

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
