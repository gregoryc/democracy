Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
