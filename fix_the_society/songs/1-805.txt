Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
