Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
