Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
