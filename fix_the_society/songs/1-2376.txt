Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

VERSE

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

VERSE

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
