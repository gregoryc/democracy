Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They do junk, they do dirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
