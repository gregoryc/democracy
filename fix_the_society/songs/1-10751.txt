Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
