Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
