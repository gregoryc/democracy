Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Whining and crying like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
