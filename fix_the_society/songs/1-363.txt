Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
