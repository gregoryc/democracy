Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

VERSE
