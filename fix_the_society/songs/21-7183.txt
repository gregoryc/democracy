Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
