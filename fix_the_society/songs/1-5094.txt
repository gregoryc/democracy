Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
