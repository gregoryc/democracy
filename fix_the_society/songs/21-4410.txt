Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
