Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard

CHORUS
