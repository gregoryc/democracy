Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
