Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
