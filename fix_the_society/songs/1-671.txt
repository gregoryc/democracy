Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Whining and crying like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
