Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
