Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
