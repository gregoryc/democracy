Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Whining and crying like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
