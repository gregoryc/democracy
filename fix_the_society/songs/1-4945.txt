Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
