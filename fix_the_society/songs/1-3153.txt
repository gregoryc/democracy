Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, they completely neglect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
