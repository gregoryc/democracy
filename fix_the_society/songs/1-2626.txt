Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
