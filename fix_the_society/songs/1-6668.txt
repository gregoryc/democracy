Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
The society itself, they completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

I must speak here, I must interject

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

The society itself, you completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is wholesale, in every aspect

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

I must speak here, I must interject

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
