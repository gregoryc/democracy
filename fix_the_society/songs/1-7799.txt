Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
