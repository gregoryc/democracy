Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
