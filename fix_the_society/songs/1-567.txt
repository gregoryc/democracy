Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
I must speak here, I must interject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
