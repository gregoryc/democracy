Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
