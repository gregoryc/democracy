Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Destruction and doom is what they architect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

It is so rude, I just need to diss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
