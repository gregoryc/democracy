VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
I must speak here, I must interject
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
I must speak here, I must interject
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
