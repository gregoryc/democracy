Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

You don't think, they act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
