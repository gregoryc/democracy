Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Evading conversation just like a kid

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
