Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

The society itself, they completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
