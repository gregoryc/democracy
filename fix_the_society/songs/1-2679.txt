Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
