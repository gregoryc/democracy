Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
