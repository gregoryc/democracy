Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
