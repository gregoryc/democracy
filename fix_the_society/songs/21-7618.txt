Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
