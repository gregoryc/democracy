Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is too insidious for many to detect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is too insidious for many to detect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is too insidious for many to detect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
