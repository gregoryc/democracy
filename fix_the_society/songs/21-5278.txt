Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
