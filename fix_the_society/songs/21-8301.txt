Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
