Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
