Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Reason is what they want to discard

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The state of science is, wholly inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
