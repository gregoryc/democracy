Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
