Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
