Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
