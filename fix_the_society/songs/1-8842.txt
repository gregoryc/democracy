Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They can't alter anything, they are inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
