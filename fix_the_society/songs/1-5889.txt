Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

VERSE

This is obvious, anyone can detect
I must speak here, I must interject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
