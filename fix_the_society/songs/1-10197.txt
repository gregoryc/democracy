Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
