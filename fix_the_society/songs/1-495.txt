Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
