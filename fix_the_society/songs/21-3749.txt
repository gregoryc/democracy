Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
