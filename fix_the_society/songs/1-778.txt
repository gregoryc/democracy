Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
