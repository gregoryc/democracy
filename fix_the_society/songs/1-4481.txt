Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

If you talk to them they miss the subject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
