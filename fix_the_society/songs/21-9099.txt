Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
