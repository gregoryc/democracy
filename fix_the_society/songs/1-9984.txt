Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

CHORUS

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
