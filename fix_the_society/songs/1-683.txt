Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Science is  fundamentally inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
