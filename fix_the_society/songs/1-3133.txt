Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The society itself, you completely neglect

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
