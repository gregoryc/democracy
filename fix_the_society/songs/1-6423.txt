Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They do junk, they do dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
