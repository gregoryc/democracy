VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The state of science is, wholly inert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
