VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
