Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
