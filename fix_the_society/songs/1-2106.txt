Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
I must speak here, I must interject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
