Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
