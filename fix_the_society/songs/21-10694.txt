Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
