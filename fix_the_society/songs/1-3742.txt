Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
