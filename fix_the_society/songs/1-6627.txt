Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
