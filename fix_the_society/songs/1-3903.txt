Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
You don't think, they act like a kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
