Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
