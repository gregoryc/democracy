Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
