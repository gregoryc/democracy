Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
