Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Evading conversation just like a kid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Evading conversation just like a kid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
