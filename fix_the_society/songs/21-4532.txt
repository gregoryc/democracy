Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
