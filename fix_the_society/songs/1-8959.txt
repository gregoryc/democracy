Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
