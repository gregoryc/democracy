Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

CHORUS

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
