Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
