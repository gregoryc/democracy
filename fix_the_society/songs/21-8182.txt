Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
