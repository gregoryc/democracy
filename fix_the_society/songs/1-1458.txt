Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
