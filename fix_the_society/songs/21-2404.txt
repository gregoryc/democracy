Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
