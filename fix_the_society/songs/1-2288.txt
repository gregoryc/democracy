Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
