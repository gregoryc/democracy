Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
