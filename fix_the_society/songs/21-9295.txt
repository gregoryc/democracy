Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
