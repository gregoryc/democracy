Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
