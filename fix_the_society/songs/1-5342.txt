Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

CHORUS

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Evading conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

No one will be unhurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Evading conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
