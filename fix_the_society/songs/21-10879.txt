Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
