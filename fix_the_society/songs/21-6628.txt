Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
