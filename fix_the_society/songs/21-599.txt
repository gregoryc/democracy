Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
