Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Not talking isn't going to divert
The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
