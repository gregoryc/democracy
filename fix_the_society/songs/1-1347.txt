Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Playing only the worst card

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Playing only the worst card

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Playing only the worst card

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
