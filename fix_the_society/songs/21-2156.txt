Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
