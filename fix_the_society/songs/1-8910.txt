Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They don't think, they act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
