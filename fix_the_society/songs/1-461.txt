Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't think, they act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
