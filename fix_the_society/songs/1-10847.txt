VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Whining and complaining like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and moaning like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Whining and complaining like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Whining and complaining like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
