Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

CHORUS

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
