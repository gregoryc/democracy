Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
