Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
