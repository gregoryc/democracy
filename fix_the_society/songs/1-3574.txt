Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

If you talk to them they miss the subject
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
