VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They make broad statements while behaving like a kid

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
