Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
