Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
