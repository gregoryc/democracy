Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
