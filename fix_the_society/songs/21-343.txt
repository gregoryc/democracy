Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
