Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Reason is what they want to discard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
