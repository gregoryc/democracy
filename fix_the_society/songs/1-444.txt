Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
