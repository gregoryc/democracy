Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
