Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
