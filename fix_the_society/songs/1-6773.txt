VERSE

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
