Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

An open conversation, they always divert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

An open conversation, they always divert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
