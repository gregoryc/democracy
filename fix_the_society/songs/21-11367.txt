Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
