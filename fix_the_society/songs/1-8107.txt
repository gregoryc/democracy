VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
You don't think, you act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
You don't think, you act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
