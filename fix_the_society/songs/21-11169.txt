Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
