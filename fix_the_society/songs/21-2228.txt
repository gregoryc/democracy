Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
