Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
