Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

CHORUS

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
