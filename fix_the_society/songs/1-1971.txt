Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

VERSE

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
