Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
