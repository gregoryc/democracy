Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
