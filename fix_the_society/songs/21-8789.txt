Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
