VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

They do junk, they do dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
