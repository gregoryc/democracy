VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
