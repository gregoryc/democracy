Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
