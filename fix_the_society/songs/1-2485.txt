Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
