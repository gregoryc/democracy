Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
