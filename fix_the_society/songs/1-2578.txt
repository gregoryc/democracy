Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
