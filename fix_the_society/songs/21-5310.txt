Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
