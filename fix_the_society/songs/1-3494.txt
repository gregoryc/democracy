Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Reason is what they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

No one will be unhurt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
