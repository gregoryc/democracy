Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
