Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
