Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Evading conversation just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
