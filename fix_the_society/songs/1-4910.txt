Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and complaining like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and complaining like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
