Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They do junk, they do dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
