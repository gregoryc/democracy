Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
