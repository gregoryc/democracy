Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
