Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
