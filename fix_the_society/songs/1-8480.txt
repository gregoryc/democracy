Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
An open conversation, they always divert
They do junk, they do dirt

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't think, you act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
