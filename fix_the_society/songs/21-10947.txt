Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
