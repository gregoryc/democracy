Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They can't alter anything, they are inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
