Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Whining and crying like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
