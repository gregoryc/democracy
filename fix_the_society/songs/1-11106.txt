Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You don't think, you act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Don't have to do with ego or id
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You don't think, you act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The society itself, you completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
