Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is too insidious for many to detect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
