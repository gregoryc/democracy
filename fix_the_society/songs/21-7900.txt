Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Inert science they consecrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
