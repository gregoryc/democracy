Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
