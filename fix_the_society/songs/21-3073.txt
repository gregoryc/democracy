Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
