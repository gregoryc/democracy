Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
I must speak here, I must interject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The society itself, they completely neglect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Whining and complaining like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
