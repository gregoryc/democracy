Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
