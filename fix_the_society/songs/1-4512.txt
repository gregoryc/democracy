Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
An open conversation, they always divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
