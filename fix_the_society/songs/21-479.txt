Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
