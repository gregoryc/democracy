Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
