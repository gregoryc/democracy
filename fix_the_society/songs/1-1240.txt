Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
