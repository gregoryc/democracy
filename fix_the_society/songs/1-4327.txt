Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
