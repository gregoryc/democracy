Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, you completely neglect
