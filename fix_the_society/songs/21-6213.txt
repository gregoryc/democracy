Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
