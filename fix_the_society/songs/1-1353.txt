Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
