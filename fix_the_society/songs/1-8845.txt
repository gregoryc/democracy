Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is plain, anyone can detect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Playing only the worst card

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
