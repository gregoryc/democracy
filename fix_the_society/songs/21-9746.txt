Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
