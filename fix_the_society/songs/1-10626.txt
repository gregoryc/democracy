Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
