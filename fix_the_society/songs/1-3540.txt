Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

No one will be unhurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
