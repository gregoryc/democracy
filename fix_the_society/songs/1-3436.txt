Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Not talking isn't going to divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
