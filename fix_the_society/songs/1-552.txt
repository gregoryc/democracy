Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
