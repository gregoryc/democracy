Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
