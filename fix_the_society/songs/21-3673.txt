Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
