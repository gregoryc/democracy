Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
