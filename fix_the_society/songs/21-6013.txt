Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
