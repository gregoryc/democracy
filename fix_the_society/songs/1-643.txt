Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They make broad statements while behaving like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They make broad statements while behaving like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They make broad statements while behaving like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
