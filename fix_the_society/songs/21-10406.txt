Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
