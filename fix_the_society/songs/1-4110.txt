Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
