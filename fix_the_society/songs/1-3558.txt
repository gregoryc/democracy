Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
