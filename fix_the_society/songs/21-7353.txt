Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
