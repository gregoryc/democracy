Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
