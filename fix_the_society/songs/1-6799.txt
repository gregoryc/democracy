Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

You make broad claims while looking like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They make broad statements while looking like a kid

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
