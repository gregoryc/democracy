Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
