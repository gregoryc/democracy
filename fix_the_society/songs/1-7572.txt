Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
