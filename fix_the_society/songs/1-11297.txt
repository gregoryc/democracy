Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred

They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred

They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Reason is what they want to discard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred

They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
If you talk to them they miss the subject

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred

They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
