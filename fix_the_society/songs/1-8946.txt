Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You don't think, they act like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is plain, anyone can detect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You don't think, they act like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You don't think, they act like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
