Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt

The society itself, they completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
