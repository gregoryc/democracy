Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
