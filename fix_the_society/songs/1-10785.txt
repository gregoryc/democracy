Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
