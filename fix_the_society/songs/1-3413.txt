Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
