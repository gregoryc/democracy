Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
