Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
