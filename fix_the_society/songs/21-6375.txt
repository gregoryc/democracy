Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
