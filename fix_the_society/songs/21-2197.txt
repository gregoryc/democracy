Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
