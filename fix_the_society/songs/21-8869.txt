Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
