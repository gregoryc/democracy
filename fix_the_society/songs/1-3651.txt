Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
