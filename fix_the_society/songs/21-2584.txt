Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
