Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

CHORUS

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too insidious for many to detect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, you completely neglect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They make broad claims while acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
