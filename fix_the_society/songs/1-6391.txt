Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Reason is what they want to discard

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
