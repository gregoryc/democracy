Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
