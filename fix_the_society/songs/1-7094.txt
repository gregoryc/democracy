Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, they completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You make broad claims while looking like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You make broad claims while looking like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
