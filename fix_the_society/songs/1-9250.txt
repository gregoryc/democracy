Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They hate themselves, they do not respect

CHORUS

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
