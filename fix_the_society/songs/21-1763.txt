Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
