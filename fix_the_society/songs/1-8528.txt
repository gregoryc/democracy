Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

CHORUS

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

It is so rude, I just need to diss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
