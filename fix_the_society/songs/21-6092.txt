Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
