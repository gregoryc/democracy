Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
