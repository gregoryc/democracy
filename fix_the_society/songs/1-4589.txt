Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
