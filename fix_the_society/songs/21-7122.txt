Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
