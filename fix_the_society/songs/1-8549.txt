Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

You make broad statements while acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
