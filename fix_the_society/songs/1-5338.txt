Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

CHORUS

Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
