Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
