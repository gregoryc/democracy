Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They do junk, they do dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
