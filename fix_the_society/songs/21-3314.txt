Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
