Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
