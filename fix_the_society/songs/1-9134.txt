Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
An open conversation, they always divert

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
