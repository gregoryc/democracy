Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't think, you act like a kid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
