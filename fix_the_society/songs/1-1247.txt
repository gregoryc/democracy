Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They do junk, they do dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
