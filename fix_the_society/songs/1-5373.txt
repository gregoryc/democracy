Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They do junk, they do dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Science is  fundamentally inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They do junk, they do dirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
