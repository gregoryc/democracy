Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
