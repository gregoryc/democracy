Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
