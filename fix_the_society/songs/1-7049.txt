Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is plain, anyone can detect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their behavior makes them charred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
