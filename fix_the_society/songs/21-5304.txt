Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
