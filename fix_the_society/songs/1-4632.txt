Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
