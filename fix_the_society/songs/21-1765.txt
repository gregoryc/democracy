Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
