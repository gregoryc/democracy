Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
