Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
The state of science is, wholly inert

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
