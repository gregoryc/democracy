Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
