Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

This is obvious, anyone can detect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
