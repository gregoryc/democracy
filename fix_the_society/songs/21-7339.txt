Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
