Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
