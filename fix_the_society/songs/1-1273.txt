Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
