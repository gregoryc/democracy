Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
