Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

If you talk to them they miss the subject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Any novel idea, they want to discard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
