Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
