Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
