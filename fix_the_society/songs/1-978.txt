Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
