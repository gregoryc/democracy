Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
