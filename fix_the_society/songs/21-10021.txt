Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
