Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

It is so rude, I just need to diss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

VERSE

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
