Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
