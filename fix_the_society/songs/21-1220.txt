Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
