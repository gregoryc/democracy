Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, they completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
