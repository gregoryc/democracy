Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
