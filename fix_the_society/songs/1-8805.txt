VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
An open conversation, they always divert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
