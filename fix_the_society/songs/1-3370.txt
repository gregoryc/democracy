Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't want to test, act just like a kid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
An open conversation, they always divert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't want to test, act just like a kid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
