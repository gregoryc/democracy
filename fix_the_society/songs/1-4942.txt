Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
