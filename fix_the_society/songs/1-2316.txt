Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their own principles are something they do not respect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
I must speak here, I must interject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
