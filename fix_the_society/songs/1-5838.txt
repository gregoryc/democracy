Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
