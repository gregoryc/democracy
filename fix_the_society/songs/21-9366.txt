Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
