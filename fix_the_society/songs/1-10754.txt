Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too insidious for many to detect

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too insidious for many to detect

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
