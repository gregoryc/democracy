Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
