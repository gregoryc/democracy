Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
