Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
