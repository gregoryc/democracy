Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
