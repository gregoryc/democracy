Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS
