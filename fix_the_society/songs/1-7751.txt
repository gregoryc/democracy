Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
I must speak here, I must interject

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS
