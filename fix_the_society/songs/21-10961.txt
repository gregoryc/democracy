Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
