Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
