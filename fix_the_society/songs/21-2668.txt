Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
