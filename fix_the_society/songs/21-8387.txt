Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
