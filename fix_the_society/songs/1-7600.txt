VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
