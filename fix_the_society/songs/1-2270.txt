Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
