Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
