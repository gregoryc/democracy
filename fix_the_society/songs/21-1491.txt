Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
