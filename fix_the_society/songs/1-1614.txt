Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
