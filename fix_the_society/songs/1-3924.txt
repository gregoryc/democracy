Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
I must speak here, I must interject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

VERSE

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
I must speak here, I must interject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
