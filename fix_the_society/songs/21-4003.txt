Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
