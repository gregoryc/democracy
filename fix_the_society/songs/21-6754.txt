Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
