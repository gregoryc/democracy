Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
