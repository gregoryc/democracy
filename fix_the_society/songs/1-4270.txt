Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
