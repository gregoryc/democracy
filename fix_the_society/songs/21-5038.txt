Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
