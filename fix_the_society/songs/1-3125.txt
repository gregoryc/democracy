Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
They do junk, they do dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
