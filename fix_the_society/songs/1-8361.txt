Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

Science is  fundamentally inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

Science is  fundamentally inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Whining and complaining like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
