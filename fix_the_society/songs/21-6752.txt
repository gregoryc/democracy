Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
