Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
