Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
You don't think, you act like a kid

CHORUS

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
