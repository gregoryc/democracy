Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
