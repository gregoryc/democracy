Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

The society itself, they completely neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Whining and complaining like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

The society itself, they completely neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Whining and complaining like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
