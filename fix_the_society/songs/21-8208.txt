Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
