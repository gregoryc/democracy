Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
