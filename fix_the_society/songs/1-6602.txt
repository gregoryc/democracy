Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

VERSE

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
