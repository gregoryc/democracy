Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
