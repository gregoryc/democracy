Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
