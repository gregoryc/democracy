VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
