Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
