Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
