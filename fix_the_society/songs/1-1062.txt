Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
