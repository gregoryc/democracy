Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
