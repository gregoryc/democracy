Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Science is  fundamentally inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
An open conversation, they always divert

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
