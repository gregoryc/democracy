Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
