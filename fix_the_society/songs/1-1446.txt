Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
I must speak here, I must interject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their minds, they cannot exert

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, you completely neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
