Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
