Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
