Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
