Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
