Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, they completely neglect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
