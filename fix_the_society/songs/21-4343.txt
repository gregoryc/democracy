Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
