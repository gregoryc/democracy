Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
