Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
