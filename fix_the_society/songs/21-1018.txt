Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
