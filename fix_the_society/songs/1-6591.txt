Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
