Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
