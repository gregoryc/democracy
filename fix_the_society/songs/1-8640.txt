Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

They do junk, they do dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
