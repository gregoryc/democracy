Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason is what they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
An open conversation, they always divert
No one will be unhurt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
An open conversation, they always divert
No one will be unhurt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
