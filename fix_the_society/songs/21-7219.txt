Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
