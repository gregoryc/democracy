Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Reason is what they want to discard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

The society itself, they completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
