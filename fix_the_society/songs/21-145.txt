Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
