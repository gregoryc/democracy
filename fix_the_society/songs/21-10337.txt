Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
