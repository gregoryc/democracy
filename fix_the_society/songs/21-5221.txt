Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
