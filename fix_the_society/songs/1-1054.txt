Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
