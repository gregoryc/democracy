Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

You don't think, they act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

You don't think, they act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
