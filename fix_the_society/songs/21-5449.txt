Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
