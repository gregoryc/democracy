Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
