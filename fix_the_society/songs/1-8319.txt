Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
