Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
