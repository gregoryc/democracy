Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, they completely neglect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You make broad statements while looking like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, they completely neglect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You make broad statements while looking like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
