Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
