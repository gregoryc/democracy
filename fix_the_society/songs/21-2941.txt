Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
