Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
I must speak here, I must interject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
