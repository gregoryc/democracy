Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
