Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
