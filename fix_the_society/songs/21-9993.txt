Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
