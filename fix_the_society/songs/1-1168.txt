Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

If you talk to them they miss the subject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
