Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
