Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
