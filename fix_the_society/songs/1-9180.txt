Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard

Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
