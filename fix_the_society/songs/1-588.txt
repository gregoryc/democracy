Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

This is too insidious for many to detect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

This is too insidious for many to detect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
