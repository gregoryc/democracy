Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is plain, anyone can detect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
