Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
