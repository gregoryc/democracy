Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
