Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior makes them charred

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

CHORUS

No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

The society itself, you completely neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
