Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
