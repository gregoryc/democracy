Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This is too insidious for many to detect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
