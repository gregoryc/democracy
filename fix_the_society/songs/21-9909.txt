Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
