Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
