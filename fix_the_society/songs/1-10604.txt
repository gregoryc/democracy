Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
