Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

CHORUS

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
