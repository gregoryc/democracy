Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
