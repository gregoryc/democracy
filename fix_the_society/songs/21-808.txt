Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
