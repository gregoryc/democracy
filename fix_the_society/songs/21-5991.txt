Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
