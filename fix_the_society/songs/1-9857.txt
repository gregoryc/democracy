Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

This is plain, anyone can detect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Reason is what they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
