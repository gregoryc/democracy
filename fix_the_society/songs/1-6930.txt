Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
