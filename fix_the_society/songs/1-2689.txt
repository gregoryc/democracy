Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

CHORUS

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

This is too insidious for many to detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
