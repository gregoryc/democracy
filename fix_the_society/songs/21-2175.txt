Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
