Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
