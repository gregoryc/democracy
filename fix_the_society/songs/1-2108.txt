VERSE

No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
