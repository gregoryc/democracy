Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
