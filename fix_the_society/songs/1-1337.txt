Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't think, they act like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
