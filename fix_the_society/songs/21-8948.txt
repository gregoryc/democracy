Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
