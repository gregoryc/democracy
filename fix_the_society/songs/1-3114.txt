Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
