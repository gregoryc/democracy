Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
