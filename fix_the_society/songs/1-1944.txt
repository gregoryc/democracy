Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Not talking isn't going to divert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The society is the ones who hurt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
