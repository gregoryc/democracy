Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
