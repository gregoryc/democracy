Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
