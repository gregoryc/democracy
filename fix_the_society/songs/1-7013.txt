Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
