Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
