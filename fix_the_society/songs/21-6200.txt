Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
