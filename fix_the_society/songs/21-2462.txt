Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
