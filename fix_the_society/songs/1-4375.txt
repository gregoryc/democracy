Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
