Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
