Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Reason is what they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
