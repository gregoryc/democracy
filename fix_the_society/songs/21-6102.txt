Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
