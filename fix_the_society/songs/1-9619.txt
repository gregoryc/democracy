Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
