Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
