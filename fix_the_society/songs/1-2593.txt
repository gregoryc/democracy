Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

VERSE

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred
