Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
