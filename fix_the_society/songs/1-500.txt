Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

VERSE

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't want to test, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Don't have to do with ego or id
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
