VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Whining and crying like a kid

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Playing only the worst card

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
