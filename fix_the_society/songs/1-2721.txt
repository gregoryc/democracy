Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, you completely neglect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
