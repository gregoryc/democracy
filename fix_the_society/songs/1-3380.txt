Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
