Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
