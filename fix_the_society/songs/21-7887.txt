Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
