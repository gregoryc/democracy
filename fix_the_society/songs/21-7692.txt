Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
