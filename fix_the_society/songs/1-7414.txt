Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
