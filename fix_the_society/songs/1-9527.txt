Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

CHORUS

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

I must speak here, I must interject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
