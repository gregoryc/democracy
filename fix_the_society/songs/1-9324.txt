Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
