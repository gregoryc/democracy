Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
