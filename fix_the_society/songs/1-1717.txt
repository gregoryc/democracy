Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
