Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
