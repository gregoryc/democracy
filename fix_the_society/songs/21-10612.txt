Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
