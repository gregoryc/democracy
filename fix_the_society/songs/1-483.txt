Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
An open conversation, they always divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
