Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
Science is  fundamentally inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
An open conversation, they always divert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
