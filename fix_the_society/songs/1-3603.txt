Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They can't alter anything, they are inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
