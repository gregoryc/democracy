Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
