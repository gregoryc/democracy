Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't think, they act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They do junk, they do dirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't think, they act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, they completely neglect

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't think, they act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The state of science is, wholly inert

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't think, they act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
