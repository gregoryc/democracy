Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
