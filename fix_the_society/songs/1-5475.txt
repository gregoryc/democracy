Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

I must speak here, I must interject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
