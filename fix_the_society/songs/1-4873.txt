VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
