Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
