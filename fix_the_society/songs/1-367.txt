Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is obvious, anyone can detect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
An open conversation, they always divert
