Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Reason is what they want to discard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Reason is what they want to discard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act like a retard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and complaining like a kid

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Reason is what they want to discard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
