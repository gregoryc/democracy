Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
