Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Playing only the worst card

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
