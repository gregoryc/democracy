Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card

Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
