Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave

The society itself, they completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
