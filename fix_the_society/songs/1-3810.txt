Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
