Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is obvious, anyone can detect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Reason is what they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
