Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

The society is the ones who hurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too insidious for many to detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

The society is the ones who hurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too insidious for many to detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

VERSE

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This is obvious, anyone can detect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
