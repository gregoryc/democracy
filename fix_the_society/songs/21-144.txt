Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
