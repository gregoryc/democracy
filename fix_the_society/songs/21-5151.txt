Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
