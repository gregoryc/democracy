Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
