Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
