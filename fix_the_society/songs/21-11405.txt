Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
