Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
