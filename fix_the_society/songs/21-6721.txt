Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
