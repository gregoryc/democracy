Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
