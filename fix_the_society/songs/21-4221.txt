Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
