Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
An open conversation, they always divert
