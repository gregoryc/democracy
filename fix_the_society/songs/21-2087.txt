Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
