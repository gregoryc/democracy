Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is obvious, anyone can detect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is obvious, anyone can detect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
