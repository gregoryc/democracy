Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
