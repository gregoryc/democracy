Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
