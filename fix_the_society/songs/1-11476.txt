Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Stop this already, time to get rid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
