Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
