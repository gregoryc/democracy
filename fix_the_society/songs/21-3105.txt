Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
