Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
