Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Science is  fundamentally inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
