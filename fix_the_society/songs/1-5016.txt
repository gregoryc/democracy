Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The society itself, you completely neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

CHORUS

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The society itself, you completely neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The society itself, you completely neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The society itself, you completely neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
