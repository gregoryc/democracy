Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
