Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Reason is what they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
