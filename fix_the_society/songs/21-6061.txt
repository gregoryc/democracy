Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
