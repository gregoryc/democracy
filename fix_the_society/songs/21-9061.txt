Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
