Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
