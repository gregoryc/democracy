Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
