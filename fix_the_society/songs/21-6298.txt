Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
