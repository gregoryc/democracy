Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't think, you act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
