Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
