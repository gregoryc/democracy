Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
