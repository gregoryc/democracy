Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
