Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
