Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Reason is what they want to discard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
