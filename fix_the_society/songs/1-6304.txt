Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

The society itself, they completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Destruction and doom is what they architect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
