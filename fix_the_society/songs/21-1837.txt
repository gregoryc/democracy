Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
