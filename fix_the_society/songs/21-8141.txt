Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
