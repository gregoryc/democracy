Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
