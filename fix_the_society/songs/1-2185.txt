Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

I must speak here, I must interject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
If you talk to them they miss the subject
The society itself, they completely neglect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
