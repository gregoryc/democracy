Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
