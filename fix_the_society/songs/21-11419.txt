Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
