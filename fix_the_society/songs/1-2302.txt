Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
