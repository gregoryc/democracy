Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
