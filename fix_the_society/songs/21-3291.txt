Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
