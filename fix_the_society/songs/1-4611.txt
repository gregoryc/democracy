Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

The society itself, you completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

The society itself, you completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
