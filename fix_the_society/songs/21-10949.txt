Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
