Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
