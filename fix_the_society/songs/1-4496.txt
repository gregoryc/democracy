VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
