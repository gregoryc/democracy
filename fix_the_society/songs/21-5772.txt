Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
