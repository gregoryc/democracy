Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
