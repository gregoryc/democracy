Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
