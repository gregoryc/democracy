Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
