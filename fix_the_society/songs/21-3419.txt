Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
