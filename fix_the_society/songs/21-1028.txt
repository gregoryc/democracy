Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Inert science they consecrate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

Inert science they consecrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
