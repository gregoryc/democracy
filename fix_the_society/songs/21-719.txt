Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
