Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
