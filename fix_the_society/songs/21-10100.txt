Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
