Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
