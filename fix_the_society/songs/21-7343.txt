Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
