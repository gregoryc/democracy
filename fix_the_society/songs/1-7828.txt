Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
