Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
