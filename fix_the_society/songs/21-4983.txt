Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
