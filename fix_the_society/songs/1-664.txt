Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Their own principles are something they do not respect

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Their own principles are something they do not respect

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
