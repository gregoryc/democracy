VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Not talking isn't going to divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
