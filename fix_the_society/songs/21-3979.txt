Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
