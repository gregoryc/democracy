Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
