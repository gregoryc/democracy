Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
