Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
