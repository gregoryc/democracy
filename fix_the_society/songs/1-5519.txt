Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
