Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The state of science is, wholly inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
