Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
