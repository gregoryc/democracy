Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
