Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
