Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
