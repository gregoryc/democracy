Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The society itself, you completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
