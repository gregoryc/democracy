Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
