Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

CHORUS

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
