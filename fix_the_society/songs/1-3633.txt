Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They walk down the Loser boulevard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect
