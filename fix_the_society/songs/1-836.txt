Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
