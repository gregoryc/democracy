Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
