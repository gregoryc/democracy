Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
