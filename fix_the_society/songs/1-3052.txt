Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
An open conversation, they always divert
The state of science is, wholly inert

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

CHORUS

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and crying like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
