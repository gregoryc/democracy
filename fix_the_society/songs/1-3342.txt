Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

The state of science is, wholly inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
