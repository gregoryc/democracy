Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Behaving just like in the schoolyard

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
