Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The society itself, you completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
I must speak here, I must interject

CHORUS

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

If you talk to them they miss the subject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Science is  fundamentally inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
