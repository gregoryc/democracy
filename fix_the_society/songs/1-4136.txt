Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
