Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is wholesale, in every aspect

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
