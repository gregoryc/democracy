Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
