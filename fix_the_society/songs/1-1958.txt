Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is too insidious for many to detect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
