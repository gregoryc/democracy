Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
