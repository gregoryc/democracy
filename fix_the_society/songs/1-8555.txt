Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
