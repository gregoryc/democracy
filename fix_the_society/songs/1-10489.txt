Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

VERSE

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Playing only the worst card

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
