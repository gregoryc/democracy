Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
