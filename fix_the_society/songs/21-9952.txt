Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
