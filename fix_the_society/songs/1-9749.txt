Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

VERSE

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Whining and crying like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
