Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
