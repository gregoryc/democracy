Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They do junk, they do dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

The society itself, they completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave

They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
