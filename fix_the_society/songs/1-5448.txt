Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
