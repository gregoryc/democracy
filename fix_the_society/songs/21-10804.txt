Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
