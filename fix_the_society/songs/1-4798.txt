Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
