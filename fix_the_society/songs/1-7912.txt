Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
