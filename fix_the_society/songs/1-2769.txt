Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
