Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
