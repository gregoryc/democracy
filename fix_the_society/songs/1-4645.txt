Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
