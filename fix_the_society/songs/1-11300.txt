Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
