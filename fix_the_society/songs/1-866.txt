Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You don't think, you act like a kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
