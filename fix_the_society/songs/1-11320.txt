Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
