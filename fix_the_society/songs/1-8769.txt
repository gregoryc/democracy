Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
