Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

The society is the ones who hurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
