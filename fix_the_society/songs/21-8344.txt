Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
