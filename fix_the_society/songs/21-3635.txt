Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
