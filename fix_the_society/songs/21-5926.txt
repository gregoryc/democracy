Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
