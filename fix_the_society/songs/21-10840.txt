Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
