Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
