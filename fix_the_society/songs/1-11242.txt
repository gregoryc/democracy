Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
