Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
