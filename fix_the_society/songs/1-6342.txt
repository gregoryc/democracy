Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
