Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
I must speak here, I must interject

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
I must speak here, I must interject

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
