Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
