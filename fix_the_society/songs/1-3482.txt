Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You make broad claims while acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
