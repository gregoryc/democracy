Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
