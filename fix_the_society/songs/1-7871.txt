VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their behavior makes them charred
