Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
