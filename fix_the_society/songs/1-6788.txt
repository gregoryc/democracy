Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
