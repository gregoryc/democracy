Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
