Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You make broad statements while looking like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You make broad statements while looking like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
