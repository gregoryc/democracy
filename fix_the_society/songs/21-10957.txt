Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
