Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
