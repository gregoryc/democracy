VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Whining and complaining like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
