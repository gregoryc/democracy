Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
