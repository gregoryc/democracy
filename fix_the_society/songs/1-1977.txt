VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
