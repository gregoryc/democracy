Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
