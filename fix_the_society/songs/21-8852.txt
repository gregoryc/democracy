Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
