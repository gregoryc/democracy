Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Destruction and doom is what they architect

The society itself, you completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
