Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
