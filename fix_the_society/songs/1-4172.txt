Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Their minds, they cannot exert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Their minds, they cannot exert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Their minds, they cannot exert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
