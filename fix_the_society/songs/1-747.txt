Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They make broad claims while acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
