Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't think, you act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
