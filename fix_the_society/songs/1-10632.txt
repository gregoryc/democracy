Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The state of science is, wholly inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

The state of science is, wholly inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

The state of science is, wholly inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
