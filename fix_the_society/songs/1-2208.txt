Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
