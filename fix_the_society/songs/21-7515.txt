Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
