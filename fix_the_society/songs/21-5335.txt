Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
