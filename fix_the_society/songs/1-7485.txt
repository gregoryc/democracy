Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Their behavior makes them charred
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their behavior makes them charred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
