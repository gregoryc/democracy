Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
