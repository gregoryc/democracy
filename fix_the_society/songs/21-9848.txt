Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
