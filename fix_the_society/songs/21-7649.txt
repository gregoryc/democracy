Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
