Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
