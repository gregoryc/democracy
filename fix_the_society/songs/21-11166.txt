Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
