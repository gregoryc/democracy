Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

The society itself, they completely neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
