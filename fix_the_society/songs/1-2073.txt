Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
