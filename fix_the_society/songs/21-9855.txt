Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Inert science they consecrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
