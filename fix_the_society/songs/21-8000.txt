Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
