Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
