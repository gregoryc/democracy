Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
