Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
