Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
