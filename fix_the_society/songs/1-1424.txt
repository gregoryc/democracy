Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
The truth is what they wish to disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
