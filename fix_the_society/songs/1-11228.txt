Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
