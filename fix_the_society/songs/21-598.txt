Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
