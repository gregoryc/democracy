Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
