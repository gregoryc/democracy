Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
