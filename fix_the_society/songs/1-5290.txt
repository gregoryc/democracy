Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is too insidious for many to detect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is too insidious for many to detect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is too insidious for many to detect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
