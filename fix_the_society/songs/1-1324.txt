Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't think, you act like a kid
