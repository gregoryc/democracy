Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
