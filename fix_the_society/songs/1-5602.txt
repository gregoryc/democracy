Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
