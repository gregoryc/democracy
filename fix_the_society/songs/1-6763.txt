Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
