Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
