Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
