Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They can't alter anything, they are inert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
