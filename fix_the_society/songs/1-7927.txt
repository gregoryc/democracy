Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Away from the truth they hid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
