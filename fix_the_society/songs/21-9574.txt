Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
