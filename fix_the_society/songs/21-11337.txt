Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
