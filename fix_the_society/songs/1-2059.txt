Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
