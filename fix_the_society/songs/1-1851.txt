Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
I must speak here, I must interject

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
