Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
