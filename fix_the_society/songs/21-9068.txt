Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
