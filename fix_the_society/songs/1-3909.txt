Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Evading conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Not talking isn't going to divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
