Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They do junk, they do dirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

CHORUS

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
