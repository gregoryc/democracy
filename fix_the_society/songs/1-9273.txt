Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
No one will be unhurt

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
