Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Away from the truth they hid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
