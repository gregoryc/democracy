Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
