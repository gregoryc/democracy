Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
