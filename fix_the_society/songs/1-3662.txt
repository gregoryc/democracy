Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They do junk, they do dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Playing only the worst card

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
