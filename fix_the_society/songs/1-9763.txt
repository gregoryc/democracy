Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
