Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
