Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
