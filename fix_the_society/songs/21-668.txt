Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
