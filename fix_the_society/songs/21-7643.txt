Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
