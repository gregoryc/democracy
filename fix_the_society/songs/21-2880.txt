Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
