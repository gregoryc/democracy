Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
