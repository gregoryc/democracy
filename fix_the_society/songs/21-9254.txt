Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
