Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
