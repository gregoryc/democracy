Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
An open conversation, they always divert

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

The society itself, they completely neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

The society itself, they completely neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

The society itself, they completely neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
