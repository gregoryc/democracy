Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
