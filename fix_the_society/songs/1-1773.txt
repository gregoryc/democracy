Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
