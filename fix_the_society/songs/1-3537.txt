VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

CHORUS

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
