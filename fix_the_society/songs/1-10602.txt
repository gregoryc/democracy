Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
