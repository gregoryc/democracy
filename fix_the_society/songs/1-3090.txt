Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
No one will be unhurt

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
