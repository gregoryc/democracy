Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
