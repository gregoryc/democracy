Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
