Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
