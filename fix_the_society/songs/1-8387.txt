Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
