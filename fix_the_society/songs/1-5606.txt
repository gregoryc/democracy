Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
