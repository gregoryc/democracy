Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
