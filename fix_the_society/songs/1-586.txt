VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
You don't think, you act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
