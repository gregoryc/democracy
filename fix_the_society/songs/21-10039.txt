Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
