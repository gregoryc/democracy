Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is too insidious for many to detect

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
