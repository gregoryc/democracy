Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
