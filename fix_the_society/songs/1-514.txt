Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

CHORUS
