Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
An open conversation, they always divert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
I must speak here, I must interject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
An open conversation, they always divert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
