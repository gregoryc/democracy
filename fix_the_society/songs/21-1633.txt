Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
