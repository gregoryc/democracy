Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
