Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
