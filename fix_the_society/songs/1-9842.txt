VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is plain, anyone can detect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
