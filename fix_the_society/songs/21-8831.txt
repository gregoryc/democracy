Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
