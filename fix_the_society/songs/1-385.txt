Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
