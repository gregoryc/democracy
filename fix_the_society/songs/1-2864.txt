Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
