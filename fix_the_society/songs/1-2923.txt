Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
