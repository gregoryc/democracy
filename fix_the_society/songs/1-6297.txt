Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
An open conversation, they always divert

An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
An open conversation, they always divert

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
