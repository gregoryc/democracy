Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
