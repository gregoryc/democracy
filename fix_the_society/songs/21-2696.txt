Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
