Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
