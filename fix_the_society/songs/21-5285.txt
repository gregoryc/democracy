Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
