Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
