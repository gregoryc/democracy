Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
I must speak here, I must interject
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
