Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
