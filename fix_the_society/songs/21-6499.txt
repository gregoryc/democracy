Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
