Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

CHORUS

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
