Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
