Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
I must speak here, I must interject

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
