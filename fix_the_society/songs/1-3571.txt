Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
