Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
