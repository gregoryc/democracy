Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
