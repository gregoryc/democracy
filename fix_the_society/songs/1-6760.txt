Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, they completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Science is  fundamentally inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
