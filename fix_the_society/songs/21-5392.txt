Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
