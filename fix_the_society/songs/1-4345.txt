Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior makes them charred

They make broad statements while acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

CHORUS

Reason is what they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
