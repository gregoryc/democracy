Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
