Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
