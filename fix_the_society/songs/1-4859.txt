Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
