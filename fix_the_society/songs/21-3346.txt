Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
