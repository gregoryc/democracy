Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

The state of science is, wholly inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
