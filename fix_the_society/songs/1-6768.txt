Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
