Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Don't have to do with ego or id
You don't think, they act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
