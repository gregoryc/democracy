Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
