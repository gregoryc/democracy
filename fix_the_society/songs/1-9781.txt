Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, you completely neglect

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
