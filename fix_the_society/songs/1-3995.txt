Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

This is too insidious for many to detect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

This is too insidious for many to detect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

This is too insidious for many to detect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

This is completely wrong, it is not correct

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

This is too insidious for many to detect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
