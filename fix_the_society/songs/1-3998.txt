Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They make broad statements while looking like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
