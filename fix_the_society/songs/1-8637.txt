Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They make broad statements while looking like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
