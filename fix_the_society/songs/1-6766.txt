Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
