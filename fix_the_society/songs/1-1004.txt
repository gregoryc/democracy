Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
