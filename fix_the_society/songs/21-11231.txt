Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
