Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
