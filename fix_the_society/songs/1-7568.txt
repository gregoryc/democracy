Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
