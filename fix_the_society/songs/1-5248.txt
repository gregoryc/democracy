Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
