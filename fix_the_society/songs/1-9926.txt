Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Reason is what they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
