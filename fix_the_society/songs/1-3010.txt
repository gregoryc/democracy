Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
