Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
An open conversation, they always divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
An open conversation, they always divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
An open conversation, they always divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
An open conversation, they always divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
