Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They are failures, down at the boulevard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

The truth is what they wish to disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
