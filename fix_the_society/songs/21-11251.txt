Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
