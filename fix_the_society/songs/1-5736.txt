Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Playing only the worst card
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
