Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
