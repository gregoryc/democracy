Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't think, you act like a kid

CHORUS

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
