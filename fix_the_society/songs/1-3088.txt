VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
