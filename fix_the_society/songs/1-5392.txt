Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Whining and crying like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
