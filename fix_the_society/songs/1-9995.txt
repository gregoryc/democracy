Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their behavior makes them charred

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Reason is what they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, you completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

They can't alter anything, they are inert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They do junk, they do dirt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Reason is what they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Reason is what they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
