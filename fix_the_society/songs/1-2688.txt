Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
