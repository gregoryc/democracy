Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is wholesale, in every aspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
The society is the ones who hurt

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is wholesale, in every aspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is wholesale, in every aspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
