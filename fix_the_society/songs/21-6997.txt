Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
