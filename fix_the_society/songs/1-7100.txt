VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't think, they act like a kid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
