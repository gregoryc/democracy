Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
