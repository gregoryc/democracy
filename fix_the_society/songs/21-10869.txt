Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
