Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
