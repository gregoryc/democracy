Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
I must speak here, I must interject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Playing only the worst card

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
