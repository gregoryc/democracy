Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
