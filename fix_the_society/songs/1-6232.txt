Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt
