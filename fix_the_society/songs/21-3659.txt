Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
