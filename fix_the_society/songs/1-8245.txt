Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
