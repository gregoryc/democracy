Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
