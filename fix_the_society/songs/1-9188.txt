Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Evading conversation just like a kid

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
They do junk, they do dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
