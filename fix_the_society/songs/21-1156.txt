Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
