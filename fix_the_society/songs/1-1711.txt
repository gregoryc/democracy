VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
