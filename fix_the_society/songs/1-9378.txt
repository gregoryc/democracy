Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
