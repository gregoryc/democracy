Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
