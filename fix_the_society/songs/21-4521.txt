Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
