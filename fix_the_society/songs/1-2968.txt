Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
An open conversation, they always divert

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

CHORUS

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
