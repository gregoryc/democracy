Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
