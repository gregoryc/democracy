Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

I must speak here, I must interject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

I must speak here, I must interject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

An open conversation, they always divert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

I must speak here, I must interject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
