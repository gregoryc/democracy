Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
