Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

VERSE

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
