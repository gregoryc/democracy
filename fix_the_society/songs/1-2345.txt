Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
