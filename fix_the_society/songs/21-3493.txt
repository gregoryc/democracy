Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
