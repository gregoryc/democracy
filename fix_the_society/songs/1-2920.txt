Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't think, they act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

This is wholesale, in every aspect

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
