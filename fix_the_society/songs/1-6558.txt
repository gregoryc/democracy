Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Not talking isn't going to divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
