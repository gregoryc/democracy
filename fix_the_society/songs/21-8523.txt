Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
