Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

The society itself, they completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
