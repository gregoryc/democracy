Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

CHORUS

This is too insidious for many to detect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, they completely neglect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
