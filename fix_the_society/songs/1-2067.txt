Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, you completely neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
