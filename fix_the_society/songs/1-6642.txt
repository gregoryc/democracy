Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
