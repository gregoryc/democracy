Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
