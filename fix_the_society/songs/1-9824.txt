VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
They do junk, they do dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Destruction and doom is what they architect

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
