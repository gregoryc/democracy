Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
