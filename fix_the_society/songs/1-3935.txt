Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is too insidious for many to detect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

They hate themselves, they do not respect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
