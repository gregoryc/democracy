Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
