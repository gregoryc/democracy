Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
