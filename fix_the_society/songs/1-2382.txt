Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
