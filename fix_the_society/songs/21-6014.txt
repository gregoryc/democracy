Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
