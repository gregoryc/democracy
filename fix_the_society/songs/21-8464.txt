Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
