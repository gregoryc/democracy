Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too insidious for many to detect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

VERSE

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
