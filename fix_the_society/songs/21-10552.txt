Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
