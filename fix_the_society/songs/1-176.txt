Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Not talking isn't going to divert

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
