Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
