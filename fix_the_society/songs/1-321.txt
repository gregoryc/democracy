VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
