Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
