Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

Away from the truth they hid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
