VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The society is the ones who hurt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
