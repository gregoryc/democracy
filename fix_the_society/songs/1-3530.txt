Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
