Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
