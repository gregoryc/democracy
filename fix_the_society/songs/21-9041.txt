Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
