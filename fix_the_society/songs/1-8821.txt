Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
