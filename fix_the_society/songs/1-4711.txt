Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
