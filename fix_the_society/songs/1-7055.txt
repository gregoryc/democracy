Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
