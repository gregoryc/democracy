Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their minds, they cannot exert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
