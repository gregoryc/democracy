Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The society is the ones who hurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Science is  fundamentally inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The society is the ones who hurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Science is  fundamentally inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
The society itself, you completely neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
