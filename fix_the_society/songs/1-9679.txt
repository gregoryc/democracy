Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Reason is what they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
