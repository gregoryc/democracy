Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

The society itself, they completely neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
No one will be unhurt
They do junk, they do dirt

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
