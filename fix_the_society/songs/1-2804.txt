Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
