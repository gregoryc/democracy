Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
