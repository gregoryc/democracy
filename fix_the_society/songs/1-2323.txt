Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The society itself, they completely neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

You make broad statements while acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
