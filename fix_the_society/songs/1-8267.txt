Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
