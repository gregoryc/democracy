Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
