Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
