VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

VERSE

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
