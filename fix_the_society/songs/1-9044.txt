Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
An open conversation, they always divert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
