Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

CHORUS

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

You make broad claims while looking like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
