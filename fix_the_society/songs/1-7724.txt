Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
