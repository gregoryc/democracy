Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
