Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
