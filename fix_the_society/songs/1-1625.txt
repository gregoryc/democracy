Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Playing only the worst card
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
