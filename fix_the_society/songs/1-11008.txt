Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
