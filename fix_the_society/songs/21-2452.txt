Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
