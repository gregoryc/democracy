Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
