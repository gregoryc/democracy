Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
