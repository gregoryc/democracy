Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
