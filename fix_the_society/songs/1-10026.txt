Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
