Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They hate themselves, they do not respect

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
