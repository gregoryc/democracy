Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Predetermined thought is that of a kid

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
