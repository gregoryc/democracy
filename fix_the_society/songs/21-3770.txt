Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
