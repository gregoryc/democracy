Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
