Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They do junk, they do dirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
