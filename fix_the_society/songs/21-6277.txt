Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
