Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
I must speak here, I must interject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, they completely neglect

I must speak here, I must interject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The state of science is, wholly inert

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
