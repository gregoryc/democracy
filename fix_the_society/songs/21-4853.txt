Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
