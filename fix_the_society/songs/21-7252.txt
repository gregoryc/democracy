Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
