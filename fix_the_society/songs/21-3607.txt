Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
