Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Reason is what they want to discard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
