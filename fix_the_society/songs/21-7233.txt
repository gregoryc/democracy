Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
