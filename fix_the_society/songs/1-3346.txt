Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

If you talk to them they miss the subject
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

CHORUS

They can't alter anything, they are inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, they completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
If you talk to them they miss the subject
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

VERSE

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
