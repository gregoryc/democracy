Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
An open conversation, they always divert

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

The truth is what they wish to disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The state of science is, wholly inert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
