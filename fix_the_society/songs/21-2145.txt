Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
