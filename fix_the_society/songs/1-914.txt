Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

CHORUS

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

No one will be unhurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
