Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
