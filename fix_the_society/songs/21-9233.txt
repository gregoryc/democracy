Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
