Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

VERSE

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
