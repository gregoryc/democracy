Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Not talking isn't going to divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
