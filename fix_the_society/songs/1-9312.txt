Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
