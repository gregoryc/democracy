Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
