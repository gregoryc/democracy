Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
