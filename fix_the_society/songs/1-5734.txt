VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Away from the truth they hid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

VERSE

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Away from the truth they hid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
