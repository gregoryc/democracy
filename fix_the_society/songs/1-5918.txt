Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
