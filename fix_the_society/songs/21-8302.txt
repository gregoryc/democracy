Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
