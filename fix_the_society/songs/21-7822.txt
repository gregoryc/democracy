Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
