Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
