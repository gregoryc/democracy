Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't want to test, act just like a kid

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
They make broad statements while looking like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
