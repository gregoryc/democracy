Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
No one will be unhurt

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
