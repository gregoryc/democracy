Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
