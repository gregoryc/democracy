Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and crying like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and crying like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
