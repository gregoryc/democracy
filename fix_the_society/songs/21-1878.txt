Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
