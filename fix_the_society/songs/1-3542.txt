VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
