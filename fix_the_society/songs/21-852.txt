Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
