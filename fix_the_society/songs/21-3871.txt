Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
