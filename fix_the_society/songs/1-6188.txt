VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They can't alter anything, they are inert
They do junk, they do dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
