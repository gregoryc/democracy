Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
