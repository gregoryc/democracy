Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
