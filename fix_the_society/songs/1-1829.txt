Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
