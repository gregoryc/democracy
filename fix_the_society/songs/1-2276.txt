Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

VERSE

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
