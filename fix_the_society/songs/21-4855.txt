Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
