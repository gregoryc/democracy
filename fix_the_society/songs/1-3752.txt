Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The society itself, they completely neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
