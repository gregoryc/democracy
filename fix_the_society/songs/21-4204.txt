Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
