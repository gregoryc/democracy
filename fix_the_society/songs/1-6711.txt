Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
