Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
The society itself, they completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
