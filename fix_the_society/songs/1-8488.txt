Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
