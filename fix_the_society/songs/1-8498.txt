Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
