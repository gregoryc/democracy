Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
