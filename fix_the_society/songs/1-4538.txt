Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and crying like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
