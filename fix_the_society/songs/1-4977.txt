Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
