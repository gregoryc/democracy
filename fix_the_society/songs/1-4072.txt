Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
