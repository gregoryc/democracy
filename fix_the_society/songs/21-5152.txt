Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
