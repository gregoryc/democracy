Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
An open conversation, they always divert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

CHORUS

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
An open conversation, they always divert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
They do junk, they do dirt

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
An open conversation, they always divert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
