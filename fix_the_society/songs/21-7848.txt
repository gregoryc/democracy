Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
