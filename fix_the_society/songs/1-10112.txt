Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
