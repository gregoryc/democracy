Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
