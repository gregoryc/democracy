Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
