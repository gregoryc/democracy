Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
