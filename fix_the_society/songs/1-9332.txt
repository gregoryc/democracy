Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Science is  fundamentally inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Their behavior makes them charred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
