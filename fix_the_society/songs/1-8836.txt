Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
