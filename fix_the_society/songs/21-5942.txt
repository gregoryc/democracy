Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
