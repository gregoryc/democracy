Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
