Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
