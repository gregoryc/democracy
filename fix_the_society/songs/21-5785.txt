Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
