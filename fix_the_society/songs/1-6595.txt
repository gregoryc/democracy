Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Don't have to do with ego or id
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
