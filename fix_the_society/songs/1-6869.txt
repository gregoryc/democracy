Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Playing only the worst card
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
