Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
