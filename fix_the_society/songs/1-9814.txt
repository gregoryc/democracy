Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
