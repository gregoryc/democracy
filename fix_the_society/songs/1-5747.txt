Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
