Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
