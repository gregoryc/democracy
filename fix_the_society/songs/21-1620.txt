Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
