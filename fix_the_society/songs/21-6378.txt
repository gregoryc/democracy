Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
