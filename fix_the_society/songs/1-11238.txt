Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
An open conversation, they always divert

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
An open conversation, they always divert

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
