Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
