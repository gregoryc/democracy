Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
