Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
An open conversation, they always divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
