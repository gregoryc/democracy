Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
