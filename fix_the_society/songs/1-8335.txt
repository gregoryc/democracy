Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
They do junk, they do dirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Whining and complaining like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

The society itself, they completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Evading conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
