Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
