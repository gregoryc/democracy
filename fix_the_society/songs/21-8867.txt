Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
