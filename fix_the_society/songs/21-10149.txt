Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
