Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They hate themselves, they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
I must speak here, I must interject

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
