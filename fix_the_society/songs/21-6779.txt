Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
