Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
