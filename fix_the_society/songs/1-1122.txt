Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
I must speak here, I must interject
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

The state of science is, wholly inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
