Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
