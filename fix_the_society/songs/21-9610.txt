Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
