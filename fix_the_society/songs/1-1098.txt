Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

VERSE

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
