Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason is what they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Science is  fundamentally inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

VERSE

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Science is  fundamentally inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
