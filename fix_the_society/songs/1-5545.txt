VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

The society itself, they completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save

The society itself, you completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Science is  fundamentally inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
