Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
