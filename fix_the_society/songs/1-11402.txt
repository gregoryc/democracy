Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This is wholesale, in every aspect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
