Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

CHORUS

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
