Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
