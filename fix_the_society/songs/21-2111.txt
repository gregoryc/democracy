Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
