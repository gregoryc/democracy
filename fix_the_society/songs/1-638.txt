Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
