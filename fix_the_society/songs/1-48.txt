Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, they completely neglect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
