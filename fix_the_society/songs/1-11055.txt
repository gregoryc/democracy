VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
