Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
