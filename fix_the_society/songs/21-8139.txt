Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
