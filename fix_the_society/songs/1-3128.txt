Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
