Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard

The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
