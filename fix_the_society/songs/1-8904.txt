Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid

CHORUS

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The society itself, they completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
