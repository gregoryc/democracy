Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
