Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They can't alter anything, they are inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
