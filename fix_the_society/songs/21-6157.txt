Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
