Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
