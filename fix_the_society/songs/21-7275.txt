Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
