Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
