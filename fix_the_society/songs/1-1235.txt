Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

VERSE

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
They do junk, they do dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
