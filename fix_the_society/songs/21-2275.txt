Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
