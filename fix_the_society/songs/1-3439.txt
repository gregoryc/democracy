Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
