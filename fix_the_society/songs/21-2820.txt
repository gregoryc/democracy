Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
