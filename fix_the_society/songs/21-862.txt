Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
