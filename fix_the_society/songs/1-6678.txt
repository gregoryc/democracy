Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

VERSE

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
