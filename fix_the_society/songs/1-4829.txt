Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
