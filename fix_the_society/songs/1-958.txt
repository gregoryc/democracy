Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Destruction and doom is what they architect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't think, you act like a kid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't think, you act like a kid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't think, you act like a kid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't think, you act like a kid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
