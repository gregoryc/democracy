Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
