Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
