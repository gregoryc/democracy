Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, they completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They can't alter anything, they are inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

You make broad statements while acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

If you talk to them they miss the subject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
