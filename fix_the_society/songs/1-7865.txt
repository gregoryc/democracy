VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
