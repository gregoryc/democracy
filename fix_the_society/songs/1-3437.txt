Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
