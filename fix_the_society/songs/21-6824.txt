Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
