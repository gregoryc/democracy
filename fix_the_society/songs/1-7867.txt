Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Not talking isn't going to divert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
