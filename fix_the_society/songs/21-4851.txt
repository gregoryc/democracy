Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
