Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
