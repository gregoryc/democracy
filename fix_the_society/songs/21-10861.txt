Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
