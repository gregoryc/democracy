Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

CHORUS

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
