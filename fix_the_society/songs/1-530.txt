Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They hate themselves, they do not respect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
