Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
