Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
