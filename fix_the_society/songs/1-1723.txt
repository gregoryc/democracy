Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
