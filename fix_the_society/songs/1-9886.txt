Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
I must speak here, I must interject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The state of science is, wholly inert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
