Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
