Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
