Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
