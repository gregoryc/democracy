VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Running away from conversation just like a kid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
