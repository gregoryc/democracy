Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
