Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
