Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
