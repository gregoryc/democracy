Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
