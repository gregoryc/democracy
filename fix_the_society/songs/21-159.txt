Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
