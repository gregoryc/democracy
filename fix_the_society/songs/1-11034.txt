Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

CHORUS

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Don't have to do with ego or id
You make broad claims while acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
