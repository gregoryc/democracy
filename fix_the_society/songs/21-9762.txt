Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
