Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
