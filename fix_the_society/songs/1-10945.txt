Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Not talking isn't going to divert

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and crying like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
