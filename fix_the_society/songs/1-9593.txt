VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
