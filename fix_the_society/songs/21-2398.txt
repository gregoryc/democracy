Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
