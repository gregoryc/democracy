Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
