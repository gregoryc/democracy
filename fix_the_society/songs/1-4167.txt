Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
