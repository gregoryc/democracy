Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
