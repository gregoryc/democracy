Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
