Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
