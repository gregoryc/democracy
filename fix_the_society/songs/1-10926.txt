Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Destruction and doom is what they architect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

VERSE

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
