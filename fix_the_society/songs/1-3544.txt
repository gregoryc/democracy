Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
