Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
