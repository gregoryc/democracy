Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
