Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
