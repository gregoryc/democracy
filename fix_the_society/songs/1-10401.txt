Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They do junk, they do dirt

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They do junk, they do dirt

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior makes them charred

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

An open conversation, they always divert

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They do junk, they do dirt

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
