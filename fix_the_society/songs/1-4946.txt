VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
I must speak here, I must interject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

CHORUS

The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
