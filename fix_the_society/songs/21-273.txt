Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
