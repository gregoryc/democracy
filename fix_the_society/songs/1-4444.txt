Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
