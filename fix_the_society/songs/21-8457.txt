Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
