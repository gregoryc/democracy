Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and crying like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
