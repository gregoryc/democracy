Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
