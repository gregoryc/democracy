Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Reason is what they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
