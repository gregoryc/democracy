Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Evading conversation just like a kid

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is plain, anyone can detect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

No one will be unhurt

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
