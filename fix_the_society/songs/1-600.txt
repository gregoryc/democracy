Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
