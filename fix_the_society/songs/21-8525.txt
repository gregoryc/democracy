Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
