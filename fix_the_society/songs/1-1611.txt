Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
