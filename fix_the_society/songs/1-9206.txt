VERSE

I must speak here, I must interject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Evading conversation just like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
