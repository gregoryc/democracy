Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their behavior makes them charred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Reason is what they want to discard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
