Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
