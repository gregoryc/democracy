Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The society itself, they completely neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
