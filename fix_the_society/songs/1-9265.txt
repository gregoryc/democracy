Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't think, you act like a kid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
