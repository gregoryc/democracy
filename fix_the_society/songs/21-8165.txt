Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
