Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Don't have to do with ego or id
Evading conversation just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Playing only the worst card
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
