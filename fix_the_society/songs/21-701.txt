Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
