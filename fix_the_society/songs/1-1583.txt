Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

All with their clique, eating their dessert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
