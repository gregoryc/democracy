Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
