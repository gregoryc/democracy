Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The state of science is, wholly inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

If you talk to them they miss the subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
