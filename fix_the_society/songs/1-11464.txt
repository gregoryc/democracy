Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
