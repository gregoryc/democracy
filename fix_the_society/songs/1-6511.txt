Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
An open conversation, they always divert

Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
