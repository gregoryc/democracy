Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
