Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
