Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Inert science they consecrate

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
