Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
