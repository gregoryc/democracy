Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
