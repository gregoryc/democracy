Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
