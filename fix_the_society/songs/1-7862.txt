VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Whining and complaining like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
