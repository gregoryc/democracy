Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
