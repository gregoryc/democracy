Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
