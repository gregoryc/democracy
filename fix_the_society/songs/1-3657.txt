Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They make broad claims while acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
