VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
