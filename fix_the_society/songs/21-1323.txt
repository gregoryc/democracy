Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
