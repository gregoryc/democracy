Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
