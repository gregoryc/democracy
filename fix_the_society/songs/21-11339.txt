Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
