VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their minds, they cannot exert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
