Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
