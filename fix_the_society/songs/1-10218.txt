Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt

VERSE

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
