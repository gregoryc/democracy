Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
