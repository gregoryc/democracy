Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
