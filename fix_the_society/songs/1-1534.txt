Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You make broad claims while looking like a kid

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
