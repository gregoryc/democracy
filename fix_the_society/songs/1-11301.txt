Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

CHORUS

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

The society is the ones who hurt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

The society is the ones who hurt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

CHORUS

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

The society is the ones who hurt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

CHORUS

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

The society is the ones who hurt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
