Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
