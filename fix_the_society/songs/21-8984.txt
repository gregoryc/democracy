Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
