Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
