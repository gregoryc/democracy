Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
