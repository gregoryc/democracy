Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
