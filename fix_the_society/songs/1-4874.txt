Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They do junk, they do dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
