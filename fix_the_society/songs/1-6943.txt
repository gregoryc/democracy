Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
