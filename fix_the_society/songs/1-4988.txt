Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
