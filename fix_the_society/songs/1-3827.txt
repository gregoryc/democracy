Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
An open conversation, they always divert

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
