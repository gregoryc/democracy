Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
The society is the ones who hurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You make broad statements while looking like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
The society is the ones who hurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You make broad statements while looking like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
