Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
