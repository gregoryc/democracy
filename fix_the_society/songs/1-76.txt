Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't alter anything, they are inert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
