Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
