Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
