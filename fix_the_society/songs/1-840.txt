Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Whining and moaning like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
