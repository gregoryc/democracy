Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The society itself, you completely neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Science is  fundamentally inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
