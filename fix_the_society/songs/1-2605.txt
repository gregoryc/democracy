Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Science is  fundamentally inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Science is  fundamentally inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
