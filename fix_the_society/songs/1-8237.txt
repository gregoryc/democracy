Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
You make broad claims while looking like a kid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
