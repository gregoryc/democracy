VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't want to test, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
