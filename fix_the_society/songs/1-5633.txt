Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their behavior makes them charred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
