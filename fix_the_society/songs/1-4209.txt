Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
