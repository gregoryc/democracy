Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and complaining like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
