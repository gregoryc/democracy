Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
