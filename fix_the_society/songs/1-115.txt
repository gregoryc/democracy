Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
