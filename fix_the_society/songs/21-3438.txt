Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
