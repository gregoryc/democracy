Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
I must speak here, I must interject
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, you completely neglect

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
