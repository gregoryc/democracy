Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
