Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
