Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
