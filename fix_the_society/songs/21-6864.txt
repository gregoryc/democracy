Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
