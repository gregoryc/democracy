Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
