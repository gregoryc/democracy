Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
