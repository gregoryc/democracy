Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
