Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
You don't think, they act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
