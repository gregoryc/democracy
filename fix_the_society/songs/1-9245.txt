Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
