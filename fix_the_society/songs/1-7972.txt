Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They make broad statements while acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
