Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
