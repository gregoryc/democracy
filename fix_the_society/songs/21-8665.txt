Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
