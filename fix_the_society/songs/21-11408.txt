Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
