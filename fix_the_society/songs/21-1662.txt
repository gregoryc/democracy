Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate
