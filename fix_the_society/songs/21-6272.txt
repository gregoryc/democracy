Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
