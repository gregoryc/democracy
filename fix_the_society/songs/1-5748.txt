Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

This is obvious, anyone can detect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
