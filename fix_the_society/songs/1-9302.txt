Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is wholesale, in every aspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
