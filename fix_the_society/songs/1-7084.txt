Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
