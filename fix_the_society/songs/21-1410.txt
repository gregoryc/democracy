Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
