Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

The society is the ones who hurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
