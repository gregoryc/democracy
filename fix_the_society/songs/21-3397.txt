Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
