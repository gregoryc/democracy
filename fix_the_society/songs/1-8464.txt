Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

I must speak here, I must interject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
