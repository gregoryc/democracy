VERSE

Whining and crying like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Evading conversation just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
