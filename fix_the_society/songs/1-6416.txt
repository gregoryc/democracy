Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
