Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
