Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
