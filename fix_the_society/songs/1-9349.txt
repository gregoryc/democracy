VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
