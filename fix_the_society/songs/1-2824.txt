VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
