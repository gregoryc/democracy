Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
