Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

I must speak here, I must interject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

I must speak here, I must interject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

I must speak here, I must interject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

I must speak here, I must interject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
