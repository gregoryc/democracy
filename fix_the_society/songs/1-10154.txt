Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The state of science is, wholly inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
No one will be unhurt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
