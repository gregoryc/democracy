Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, you completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
