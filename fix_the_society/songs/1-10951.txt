Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They do junk, they do dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
An open conversation, they always divert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
