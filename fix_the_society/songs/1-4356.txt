Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
