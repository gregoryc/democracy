Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

This is too insidious for many to detect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
