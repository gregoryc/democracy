Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
