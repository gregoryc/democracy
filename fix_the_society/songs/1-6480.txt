Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
