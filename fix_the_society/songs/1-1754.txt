Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You make broad statements while acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You make broad statements while acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You make broad statements while acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You make broad statements while acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
