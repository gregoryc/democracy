Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
