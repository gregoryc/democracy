Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
