Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
