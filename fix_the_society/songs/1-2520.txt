Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
