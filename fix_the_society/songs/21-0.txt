Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
