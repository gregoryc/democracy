Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
